<!-- General purpose of this section: 
Motivate Dashboards and conclude that it is important to understand how graphs are perceived and used by various target audiences. -->
<p>Statisticians use graphs in almost every stage of their work: we create charts when we get new data, to explore what we have and identify potential problems and opportunities.
We fit models based on relationships between variables which are often identified visually.
We identify problems with those models based on residual plots and other visual diagnostics.
When our modeling work has been completed, we present our results to interested parties using visual displays, because non-statisticians often find it easier to understand data and models through an intuitive visual medium rather than through the mathematical formulae which underlie the statistical work.</p>
<p>Given the wide range of uses for graphs and visual data displays in statistical modeling, it is unsurprising that some graphs are more useful for specific applications such as exploratory analysis, and are unsuitable for other applications, such as presentation to an outside group.
In addition, we know that not all visual displays have equal perceptual value <span class="citation">(Aspillaga, 1996)</span>.
The best graphics are designed to account for both the features of the dataset and the features of the intended audience.
Some design constraints stem from limitations of the human perceptual system and are common to most potential consumers of the visualization: the sine illusion <span class="citation">(VanderPlas &amp; Hofmann, 2015b)</span> affects anyone with binocular depth perception, and color recommendations are built around the specific characteristics of the human retina.
Other design constraints are due to the audience’s experience level: are they used to working with data?
Do they understand specialized techniques such as principal component analysis to the point where a plot of factor loadings might be useful ?
When we create visualizations for public consumption we have to consider both perceptual factors and the target audience’s domain knowledge.
In this introduction, we explore previous research related to the construction of interactive and static visual displays for different audiences and consider the implications of this research when designing interactive data displays such as dashboards.</p>
<!-- We wish to discuss and analyze the exploration of using density plots or categorical plots as "best" plots in the field. -->
<!-- Wait, what? Density plots or categorical plots are the best plots?? -->
<!-- We will analyze statistical data and graphics alongside dashboard design, starting with Steven Few's principles.  -->
<!-- This is said in the prev paragraph, minus Few, which we can cite later -->
<!-- It would be worthwhile to investigate the development of dashboards from static graphical representations in a practical setting to dynamic representations in an application setting.  -->
<!-- We would like to see the application of research to practice. -->
<!-- Consider a novel concept in research can be less practical or useful in the field more often than not.  -->
<p>For example, in sports, many coaches desire printable diagrams containing all necessary and valuable information on a single page.
As data in sports becomes more prominent, extensive, and collected, this information must be refined.
<!-- We will adopt the concept of dynamically introducing the application to stakeholders with a static representation and migrating them into an active application.  -->
<!-- Once this dynamic application is utilized or migrated to that space, it is necessary to comprehend why categorical representations are more critical than density representations in the field.  -->
<!-- In regards to speaking about the same data being represented, most of the data is then categorized.  -->
<!-- Is it because categorical shot charts in tables are perceived to be digestible or because density plots become cluttered and difficult to comprehend?  -->
<!-- Where do we draw the line between what is viewed as an impediment to the development of applicable graphics methodology? -->

<li><p>Vision, and how we perceive or interpret what we see, is primarily the result of our brain and nervous system transmitting sensory stimuli through neural pathways.
This is why people with perfectly functioning eyes, such as those with Cortical Visual Impairment, may be unable to see if the pathways to the brain are miswired or damaged (see a viz on that here).</p></li>
<li><p>While 70% of our experience of the world is gained through vision, our brains can only simultaneously process less than 5% of our visual environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Gestalt principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proximity: Objects close to each other are perceived as related or grouped.</li>
<li>Similarity: Objects that are similar in some way (e.g., shape, color, size) are perceived as related or grouped.</li>
<li>Continuation: The human eye follows lines and patterns, so designers can use this principle to guide the viewer’s gaze through a display.</li>
<li>Closure: The human brain tends to complete incomplete figures or patterns, so designers can use this principle to create the illusion of missing information.</li>
<li>Figure-Ground: The human brain separates the foreground (figure) from the background (ground), so designers can use this principle to create visual hierarchy and emphasis.</li>
<li>Contrast: The human eye is drawn to high-contrast areas, so designers can use this principle to create emphasis and hierarchy.</li>
<li>Symmetry and Balance: The human eye finds symmetry and balance visually pleasing, so designers can use this principle to create a sense of harmony and order.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Attention and Memory<a href="introduction.html#attention-and-memory" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Short-term memory (STM), also known as working memory, is the stage of temporary storage and processing where the majority of memory retention effort is expended.
According to <span class="citation">Baddeley (2012)</span>, STM is a limited-capacity system prone to interference and decay.
Selective attention is essential for the maintenance of STM because it allows us to filter out irrelevant information and concentrate on what is essential <span class="citation">Cowan (2001)</span>.</p>
<p>Visual aids such as charts and diagrams can improve short-term memory by allowing us to encode and retain information more effectively, according to research <span class="citation">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh (2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Consequently, utilizing visual aids such as charts can be advantageous for enhancing our short-term memory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, annotations can also be useful in aiding short-term memory.
By adding annotations, such as notes or highlights, to information we are trying to remember, we can improve our recall of the information later on <span class="citation">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh (2004)</span>.</p>
<!-- Feature Integration Theory -->
<p>According to the Feature Integration Theory (FIT), STM is composed of two stages: pre-attentive processing and focused attention <span class="citation">A. Treisman (1998)</span>.
Parallel and independently, the brain processes the physical characteristics of an object, such as its color, shape, and orientation, during pre-attentive processing.
However, focused attention is required to bind these features into a coherent object representation in STM.
STM can be improved through various strategies, such as rehearsal, chunking, and elaboration <span class="citation">Oberauer (2009)</span>.
For example, by repeating a phone number several times or breaking it down into chunks of two or three digits, we can increase the likelihood of it being stored in STM.
Similarly, by elaborating on the information we want to remember, such as creating mental associations or visual images, we can enhance its retention in STM <span class="citation">Bui &amp; Myerson (2014)</span>.</p>
<p>STM is a dynamic and malleable cognitive system that is crucial to our daily lives.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying STM and how to improve it can have significant implications for learning, memory, and the treatment of memory disorders.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Constructing Meaning<a href="introduction.html#constructing-meaning" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Gestalt psychology suggests that humans actively construct meaning by organizing information into patterns and wholes <span class="citation">Wertheimer (1938)</span>.
Both top-down and bottom-up processing are involved in the process of meaning construction.
Bottom-up processing entails analyzing sensory data from the environment and constructing perceptions based on this data.
Top-down processing is the influence of prior knowledge, expectations, and context on the perception and interpretation of incoming sensory data.</p>
<p>Together, top-down and bottom-up processing facilitate the encoding and retrieval of information in the context of short-term memory.
Selective attention, the ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information, is an example of top-down processing that aids in the encoding and retrieval of information in short-term memory <span class="citation">Cowan (2010)</span>.<br />
According to the feature integration theory, the perception of objects involves both the bottom-up analysis of individual features and the top-down processing of higher-level features in order to form a complete perception <span class="citation">A. M. Treisman &amp; Gelade (1980)</span>.</p>
<p>The Gestalt principles of perception emphasize the significance of bottom-up and top-down processing in constructing meaning from sensory data.
Both types of processing are involved in encoding and retrieving information, which has significant implications for understanding how short-term memory works.</p>

<p>However, creating effective graphics is not a simple task, and proficiency in this area is required to create high-quality visualizations.
This essay will discuss the contributions to the field of graphics made by research on psychological processes, automaticity, readily available information, and practice effects.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Processes - the way we think about and approach a task.</strong></p>
<p>As we become more proficient in a particular skill, we develop more complex and efficient mental models or schemata.
These mental models help us to organize information in a meaningful way, and to quickly identify and solve problems related to the task.
This process is known as cognitive restructuring and is facilitated by developing domain-specific knowledge <span class="citation">Ericsson &amp; Lehmann (1996)</span>.
For example, a chess master is able to quickly recognize patterns and positions on the board that are common in chess, which allows them to make decisions more quickly and accurately than a novice player.</p>
<p><strong>Automaticity - the ability to perform a task without conscious effort or attention</strong></p>
<p>As our proficiency in a task increases, our performance becomes more automatic, thereby freeing up cognitive resources for other tasks.
The development of procedural knowledge, which is the ability to perform a series of steps or actions in a particular order, facilitates this process <span class="citation">Fitts &amp; Posner (1967)</span>.
For instance, a skilled typist can type without looking at the keyboard because their finger movements have become automatic.</p>
<p><strong>Information Readily Available - the way we process information related to a task</strong></p>
<p>As our proficiency increases, we can recognize and retrieve pertinent information more rapidly and precisely than a novice.
This is made possible by the creation of domain-specific knowledge structures that allow us to retrieve pertinent information from memory quickly <span class="citation">Chase &amp; Simon (1973)</span>.
For instance, a medical expert can quickly identify signs and diagnose a patient using their knowledge of disease symptoms and risk factors.</p>
<p><strong>Practice Effects - extensive practice and experience</strong></p>
<p>Practice effects are the performance enhancements that result from repeated practice.
These gains are frequently most significant at the outset of practice, but gradually diminish as the individual approaches their performance ceiling <span class="citation">Anderson (1982)</span>.
The development of procedural knowledge and automaticity, which allow for more efficient and accurate task performance, facilitates the effects of the practice.</p>
<p>The contributions of research on psychological processes, automaticity, readily available information, and practice effects to the field of graphics have significant implications.
Expertise is required to create high-quality graphics, which requires a thorough understanding of design principles and the capacity to work quickly and efficiently.
The use of automatic processing and domain-specific knowledge can aid designers in processing and deciding on design elements efficiently and quickly.
The creation of standardized design templates, workflows, and other tools can aid in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the design process.
Design skills can be improved through deliberate guidelines, and educators must focus on developing skills that can be applied in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>As the significance of graphics in numerous fields continues to rise, the demand for specialists in this area will only intensify.
By comprehending the contributions of research on psychological processes, automaticity, readily accessible information, and practice effects, designers, educators, and trainers can develop more effective approaches to graphics design and education.
This can help ensure that the graphics used to convey complex information are clear, concise, and effective, making it easier for individuals to comprehend and interpret the required information.</p>

<p>Grammar allow us to separate data type from rendering</p>
<p>It doesn’t help us decide which is better - for that we need user testing.</p>
<!--### How do we classify graphics? -->
<p>In the field of graphical communication, semiology, or the study of signs and symbols and their use in communication, has been a valuable tool.
One of the fundamental principles of semiology is the relationship between signifier and signified, in which a visual element (the signifier) represents a particular meaning or concept (the signified) (<span class="citation">(<strong>barthes1972?</strong>)</span>).
Another essential concept in semiology is the utilization of syntax and semantics to effectively convey meaning in graphic communication.
This includes both the syntax and semantics of a graphic’s visual elements (<span class="citation">Monmonier (1985)</span>).</p>
<p>The use of color to represent data on maps is an example of successful graphical communication utilizing semiology.
By using different colors to represent different data points, viewers can comprehend patterns and relationships in the data quickly and easily.
Jacques Bertin writes in “Semiology of Graphics” that color can be used to “emphasize a point, distinguish one category from another, or establish a relationship between two points”, <span class="citation">Monmonier (1985)</span>.
In addition, Bertin explains that the use of color can help overcome language barriers, making it easier for the audience to comprehend the presented information.</p>
<p>Graphs are another tool that can be used to effectively communicate information via semiology.
By utilizing visual elements such as bars and lines to represent data, graphs can make complex information more understandable to viewers.
For instance, a line graph can be used to illustrate the change in value of a stock over time, making it easier for investors to identify trends and patterns. Leland Wilkinson (<span class="citation">Wilkinson (2012)</span>) writes in his book “The Grammar of Graphics” that “graphical methods are not only superior to other forms of communication, but also superior to numerical or verbal methods for certain types of data and reasoning.”</p>
<p>The components of the grammar of graphics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data: The raw data being visualized represents a set of observations or values.</li>
<li>Aesthetic Mappings: The mapping of data variables to visual properties such as position, color, shape, and size.</li>
<li>Scales: The mapping of data values to visual values, such as mapping a numerical value to a bar height.</li>
<li>Geometries: The basic shapes representing the data, such as points, lines, bars, and histograms.</li>
<li>Facets: The plot division into multiple subplots, each representing a different subset of the data.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.2: Grammar of Graphics Diagram of Wickham and Wilkinson’s work
</p>
</div>
<p>The application of semiology in graphical communication is not devoid of obstacles.
One difficulty is the possibility of misinterpretation, in which viewers may assign a different meaning to a visual element than was intended (<span class="citation">Monmonier (1985)</span>).
Another concern is the possibility of cultural differences in interpretation, in which a visual element may have a different meaning in one culture versus another (<span class="citation">Norman (2013)</span>).</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, semiology in graphical communication remains an indispensable tool for effectively conveying information.
By understanding semiology principles and syntax and semantics’ role in graphical communication, designers can create compelling visual representations that convey information clearly and concisely.</p>
<p>Michael Friendly has investigated the origins and development of graphic techniques, tracing their evolution from antiquity to the present.
By emphasizing the role of graphical methods in scientific discovery, Friendly has helped promote his use in various disciplines, from the natural sciences to the social sciences and beyond.
In his book “Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography, Statistical Graphics, and Data Visualization,” Friendly provides a comprehensive overview of the key milestones in the evolution of statistical graphics, including the contributions of pioneers like William Playfair, Charles Minard, and John Tukey (<span class="citation">Friendly &amp; Denis (2001)</span>).</p>
<!--His historical research has yielded significant insights into the origins and evolution of graphical methods, while his development of new techniques has increased the number of data visualization tools available. -->

<!--### what do we know about "better" graphics for certain tasks? -->
<p>Effective graphics can be a powerful tool for communicating complex information, which makes numerical accuracy, engagement, correct decision-making, and accurate predictions crucial considerations.</p>
<p>Numerical accuracy: In the context of data visualization, numerical accuracy refers to the precision and correctness of the numerical data displayed in graphics.
Accurate graphics can assist users in comprehending complex numerical data and making more informed decisions (<span class="citation">Cardoso, Leite, &amp; Aquino (2016)</span>).</p>
<p>Engagement: Engagement in the context of data visualization is the extent to which viewers are drawn to and interested in the displayed data.
Engaging graphics can encourage users to interact with and explore data further, resulting in a more thorough comprehension of the data.</p>
<p>Correct Decision Making: Correct decision making refers to the capacity of data visualization to enable users to make informed and precise decisions based on the presented information.
Clear, accurate, and well-designed graphics can help users recognize patterns and insights, resulting in more effective decision making.</p>
<p>Correct Predictions: Correct predictions refers to the capability of graphics to accurately forecast or predict future events or outcomes.
For accurate predictions, data visualization must include trustworthy data, sound statistical models, and efficient visualization techniques.</p>
<p>“Graphical Tests for Power Comparison of Competing Designs” by Hofmann et al. presents a graphical method for comparing the power of two or more competing designs in an experimental study <span class="citation">(<strong>hofmann2012?</strong>)</span>.
The article demonstrates that the graphical method is a useful tool for comparing the effectiveness of various experimental designs.
It enables researchers to visualize and compare the effectiveness of different designs in an intuitive and straightforward manner.</p>
<p>Two methods for measuring the particle size distribution in a chemical process were compared in one study.
The study evaluated both designs under various operating conditions and compared their power using a graphical method.
The results demonstrated that one design was more effective at detecting differences in operating conditions than another.</p>
<!-- ### General guidelines -->
<p>When designing visuals, it is essential to consider the cognitive load they may place on the viewer.
Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort required to process information, and minimizing it can enhance a graphic’s effectiveness.
In addition, displaying as much raw data as possible while minimizing cognitive load can improve the graphic’s clarity and precision.
Here are some general guidelines for making better graphics with works from (<span class="citation">(<strong>few2012?</strong>)</span>, <span class="citation">(<strong>tufte1983?</strong>)</span>, <span class="citation">Cairo (2016)</span>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Keep it simple - Avoid overwhelming the viewer with too much information at once by employing a clear and concise design with minimal distractions.</p></li>
<li><p>Use visual hierarchy - Utilize size, color, contrast, and placement to highlight important information and direct the viewer’s focus.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose appropriate charts - Choose the chart type that best illustrates the data and facilitates comprehension.</p></li>
<li><p>Label clearly - Use labels that are clear and concise for axes, legends, and other essential information to avoid confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Use data-to-ink ratio - Focus on the data by minimizing the amount of non-data ink, such as decorative elements or excessive grid lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid distortion - Use appropriate scaling and avoid distortions to ensure that the graphics accurately represent the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide context - Add context to assist the viewer in comprehending the significance of the data and its relevance to the topic.</p></li>

<p>Heer and Bostock examined how the complexity of interactive visualizations influences the cognitive load of users (<span class="citation">Heer &amp; Bostock (2010)</span>).
The authors discovered that more intricate visualizations tend to increase cognitive load, especially for users with lower visual literacy.
They recommended that designers consider the cognitive load of interactive visualizations and strive to reduce complexity whenever possible.</p>
<p>Eissele et al investigated the cognitive load of mobile interactive visualizations (<span class="citation">Eissele, Weiskopf, &amp; Ertl (2009)</span>).
The authors discovered that the limited input options and small screen size of mobile devices can increase cognitive load in interactive visualizations.
To reduce cognitive load on mobile devices, they suggested that designers employ suitable visual encoding techniques and simplify interactions.</p>
<p>Toyama et al. investigated the impact of interactive elements on cognitive load in visualizations. (<span class="citation">Toyama, Sonntag, Orlosky, &amp; Kiyokawa (2015)</span>)

<p>Cleveland and McGill investigated the effect of various bar chart designs on the accuracy with which viewers perform simple perceptual tasks <span class="citation">Cleveland &amp; McGill (1986)</span>.
People perform significantly worse on stacked bar charts than on simple bar charts, and bar charts with filled bars are generally superior to those with empty ones.</p>
<p>Jiao et al. examine the use of unit charts to represent large-scale data <span class="citation">(<strong>jiao?</strong>)</span>.
The study discovered that unit charts are more precise and easier to read than traditional bar graphs for representing values across multiple orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>“The cognitive style of PowerPoint: Pitching out corrupts within” examined the effect of static graphics, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, on the comprehension and decision-making of viewers <span class="citation">Edward R. Tufte (2008)</span>.
The results indicated that the bar chart was most effective at accurately communicating information, while the pie chart was least effective.
In addition, the researchers discovered that the type of graphic employed influenced the viewers’ perceptions and decision-making, highlighting the significance of selecting the most appropriate graphics when conveying information.</p>
<p>“Using color to code different types of uncertainty in visualization” investigated the effect of color on the communication effectiveness of static graphics <span class="citation">(<strong>ware2010?</strong>)</span>.
Researchers discovered that the use of color in static graphics enhanced viewers’ comprehension and memory retention of the presented information.
Specifically, it was determined that the use of color to highlight particular data points or trends in a graph or chart was particularly effective.</p>
<p>“Communicating Uncertainty: A Look at Graphical Representations of Error Bars, Box Plots, and Confidence Intervals” examined the efficacy of static graphics in communicating data uncertainty and variability <span class="citation">(<strong>wainer2020?</strong>)</span>.
Researchers discovered that static graphics, such as boxplots and error bars, effectively communicated the range and variability of data.
Furthermore, the use of static graphics enhanced viewers’ comprehension and decision-making in uncertain situations.</p>
<p>Overall, these above studies indicate that static graphics are effective at conveying information to viewers, with their effectiveness being influenced by the type of graphic exercised, the use of color, and their capacity to convey uncertainty and variability in data.
However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of static graphics can also be affected by audience knowledge and experience, the complexity of the information being presented, and the context in which the graphics are used.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Testing interactive graphics<a href="introduction.html#testing-interactive-graphics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The design space of interactive visualizations, including the use of multiple views and coordinated multiple views, is discussed in a paper by Heer and Bostock <span class="citation">Heer &amp; Shneiderman (2012)</span>.
The authors argue that interactive visualizations can enhance comprehension and decision-making by enabling users to investigate complex data and the relationships between multiple variables.
It was discovered that interactive graphics are particularly useful for investigating data that is difficult to comprehend with static graphics, such as time series data or data with multiple aggregation levels.</p>
<p>Compared to static graphics, interactive graphics can improve users’ ability to identify patterns and outliers in data, according to a second study <span class="citation">(<strong>wu2017?</strong>)</span>.
This is due to the fact that interactive graphics enable users to zero in on particular aspects of the data and adjust the visualization in real time to reveal hidden patterns.</p>
<p>It has also been discovered that interactive graphics increase user engagement with data and improve their decision-making abilities.
“Visualizing decision-making: Introducing the analysis, comparison, and exploration system (ACES)” showed that interactive graphics can help users make more informed decisions by allowing them to compare and contrast various scenarios and outcomes <span class="citation">(<strong>kornhauser2014?</strong>)</span>.
Moreover, interactive graphics can help users identify potential biases or errors in their data analysis by allowing them to rapidly explore various visualizations and test their hypotheses.</p>
<p>In addition to their benefits for data exploration and analysis, interactive graphics have been found to be more engaging and enjoyable for users <span class="citation">Eppler &amp; Bresciani (2013)</span>.
This can increase the motivation of users to explore and analyze data, resulting in better decision-making.</p>
<p>In summary, the studies highlighted indicate that interactive graphics can be an effective data visualization and analysis tool, especially for complex and multidimensional data.
They can improve users’ comprehension, engagement, and decision-making skills, and are ideal for examining data that is difficult to comprehend with static graphics.</p>

<!-- This is where your paragraph about 2 good graphics being suboptimal together should go -->
<p>Combining two effective graphics does not necessarily result in a successful visualization.
In certain instances, suboptimal combinations can result in confusion, misinterpretation, and the failure to convey the intended message.
Combining two charts with distinct scales or units is an example of suboptimal graphic design, which can result in misinterpretation and flawed comparisons.
For example, if a bar chart displaying the number of sales is combined with a line chart displaying revenue, meaningful comparisons between the two metrics can be challenging.
People frequently make inaccurate judgments when comparing graphs with different scales, according to a study conducted by Cleveland and McGill (<span class="citation">Cleveland &amp; McGill (1984)</span>).</p>
<p>Utilizing redundant visual cues or unnecessary embellishments is another example of suboptimal graphics.
Although it may be tempting to add extra elements to a chart or graph, doing so can detract from the primary message and make it more difficult for the audience to focus on the essential information.
Tufte discovered that adding unnecessary visual cues to a graph decreases its effectiveness because viewers are more likely to focus on the embellishments rather than the data (<span class="citation">Edward R. Tufte (1985)</span>).</p>
<p>Using multiple color schemes or palettes in the same chart is another instance of suboptimal graphics.
While color can be an effective visual communication tool, the use of excessive colors or color schemes can be overwhelming and confusing.
This can detract from the primary message and make it challenging for the audience to comprehend the key points.
In a study conducted by Heer and Bostock, participants were required to interpret multiple color schemes (<span class="citation">Heer &amp; Bostock (2010)</span>).
Multiple color schemes made it difficult for participants to identify the relationships between different parts of the visualization, according to the study.</p>
<p>Conversely, it can be suboptimal to combine two visually incompatible graphics.
For instance, if a scatter plot and a bar chart are combined, the resulting visualization may be difficult to interpret due to the incompatibility of the two types of graphics.
This issue was highlighted by Hullman et al., who discovered that viewers had difficulty interpreting a visualization that incorporated a scatter plot and a line chart (<span class="citation">Hullman, Adar, &amp; Shah (2011)</span>).</p>
