\db{In general, density plots represent the distribution of continuous variables, while categorical plots represent the distribution of categorical or discrete variables.
The interpretation of density plots typically involves understanding the shape of the distribution and the presence of any outliers or skewness. 
On the other hand, categorical plots aim to show the frequency or count of observations in each category.}

\db{When comparing density plots and categorical plots, it's essential to consider the data analysis type. 
For continuous data, a density plot may provide a more informative representation of the distribution. 
A categorical plot may provide a more intuitive representation of the distribution of categorical data.}

\db{However, for various reasons, some people may prefer one type of plot over the other. 
For example, some may find density plots more visually appealing, while others may prefer categorical plots for their simplicity and ease of interpretation. 
Ultimately, the choice between the two types of plots will depend on the context and purpose of the analysis and the preferences of the individual interpreting the data.}

\db{Do we comprehend why we utilize the graphics we do? 
Is there a reason we adopt the perception of a previously used graphic? 
How do we determine whether there are superior graphical representations when the human brain has determined that this is what I comprehend? 
How do we develop statistical methodologies based on effective testing of statistical graphics on human perceptions of excellent and good? 
How do we determine the line distinguishing a density plot from a categorical plot? 
Consequently, how is this decision made outside of academia and research? 
In one way, research has been conducted on the visual or human perception of categorical plots.}

\db{In addition to graphical elements alongside numerical values and plots such as Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs). 
We wish to discuss and analyze the exploration of using didn't report plots or categorical plots as density plots in the field. 
We will analyze statistical data and graphics alongside dashboard design, starting with Steven Few's whites. 
It would be worthwhile to investigate the development of dashboards from static graphical representations in a practical setting to dynamic representations in an application setting. 
This is the application of research to practice.}

\db{What may be considered an exciting thought process in research that is less practical or useful in the field? 
For example, in sports, many coaches desire printable diagrams containing all necessary and valuable information on a single page. 
As data in sports becomes more prominent, extensive, and collected, this information must be refined. 
We will adopt the concept of dynamically introducing the application to stakeholders with a static representation and migrating them into an active application. 
Once this dynamic application is utilized or migrated to that space, it is necessary to comprehend why categorical representations are more critical than density representations in the field. 
We're speaking about the same data being represented. 
However, most of the data is then categorized. 
Is it because categorical shot charts in tables are perceived to be digestible or because density plots become cluttered and difficult to comprehend? 
Where do we draw the line between what is viewed as an impediment to the development of applicable graphics methodology?}

\db{Subject matter graphics are visual representations of information and data that help communicate complex concepts, ideas, and information to audiences.
This expertise is related to knowledge of the topic or subject being presented in the graphic.
A subject matter expert is someone who has a deep understanding of how people perceive and interpret visual information. 
Subject matter experts (SMEs) have deep knowledge and experience in a specific field, such as science, finance, or medicine. 
SMEs provide the necessary information and insights to form the graphic's basis. 
They ensure that the content presented is accurate, relevant, and informative. 
They use their human perception and cognition knowledge to design graphics that effectively communicate information to the intended audience. 
Perception experts in graphics consider a range of factors, including color, shape, size, texture, and spatial relationships, to create graphics that are visually appealing and easy to understand.}

\db{Perception experts in graphics may use different theories and principles to inform their design decisions. 
For example, they may use Gestalt principles to create visually harmonious and organized graphics. 
They may also use the principles of visual hierarchy to guide the audience's attention to the essential information in the graphic.}

\db{Perception experts in graphics may also conduct user research to understand how different audiences perceive and interpret visual information. 
They may use eye-tracking and user testing techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of different graphic designs.}

\db{A perception expert plays a crucial role in designing graphics that effectively communicate information to the intended audience. 
Their knowledge of human perception and cognition, as well as their expertise in graphic design, allows them to create visually appealing and easily understood graphics.}

\db{Visualizing Complex Data is representing complex, multi-dimensional data in a graphical or pictorial form to make it easier to understand and interpret. 
The goal is to turn large, intricate data sets into visually appealing and intuitive representations, such as charts, graphs, maps, and other types of visualizations, to help identify patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be immediately apparent from raw data. 
This process can help to communicate complex information effectively and make data-driven decisions.}


William Cleveland's subcycle plots:

- glyph maps and binned graphics emerging from big data visualization efforts.
- glyphs and other plots have been embedded in maps 

<!-- How do we classify charts? -->
Bertin's Semiologic of Graphics is a seminal work in the academic study of visualization. 
[@schulz2013] define two abstractions for the design of visualizations:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
  Data + Task = Visualization \\
  Data + Visualization = Task
\end{align*}
\end{center}

\db{These abstractions demonstrate dependence between the data, visual representation, and the task. 
The more the user interacts with the visualization, they gain knowledge. 
The interactions allow the user to control their understanding by providing the flexibility to create new views that help them go beyond just the visual representation [@kiem2008]. 
The field of information visualization is continually adapting to changes with the big data revolution.}

\db{Data Scientists and Statisticians have produced more graphics since the pandemic's start. 
The reasons someone will create a graphic or dashboard may include but are not limited to understanding raw data structures to analyze model assumptions and present predictions, along with displaying key performance metrics of business logic. 
These goals help work to navigate and are best served by quick-and-dirty representations of the data, while highly polished graphics may be more useful in other situations. 
It is valuable and essential to convey data correctly, meaning that we need to understand how graphics are perceived on a dashboard on a general level. Previous research by Tukey focused on graphics as a tool for exploratory analysis. 
Tukey describes in Exploratory Data Analysis [@tukey1966] that pictures are often used to display data in a more enhanced version than a table. 
Tukey outlines detailed the types of different graphics and in which situations to utilize these graphics. 
The article - "External cognition: how do graphical representations work?" by Scaife and Rogers [@scaife1996] critique the disparate literature on graphical representations, focusing on four representative studies. 
In general, this will help in the psychology of the perceptual experience.}


\db{The visual reference model developed by Card et al. [@Card] describes and identifies the three phases of the visualization process.}

```{r graphics, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%",fig.cap='Visual Reference model by Card',fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/VizModelDiagram.png")
```

\db{While External Cognition describes the advances in graphical technology and how little had been done in the work of the cognitive framework of the discipline, the following citations by Ware attempt to develop the necessary guidelines that are useful for the work done by the perceptual experience.}

Colin Ware "Information Visualization: Perception for Design" [@Ware2004] there are four stages of visualization

- The collection and storage of data itself
- The preprocessing design to transform the data into something we can understand
- The display hardware and the graphics algorithms produce the image on the screen.
- The human perceptual and cognitive system


\db{The overlapping understanding in the field, while Ware takes the process one step further not just to allow the end user to understand the outcomes but to curate the outcomes with a visual perception of the data that makes the cognitive load easier for the end-user.}

\db{A dashboard has much information related to tabular data from multiple sources. 
Design should be recorded a produced with content that will allow for reproducibility. 
A dashboard should have some content related to interaction with the user. 
This interaction can be in multiple forms: toggling through the selection of variables to display uniformly to the use of interaction on the graph and allowing a user to understand best what is being shown in the diagram.}

\db{The entire dashboard/Interface should have a human perception piece that is useful for the user to comprehend and use. 
For example, the dashboard/interface could be more practical if the user is visually overwhelmed.}

- Identified the highly relevant from a dashboard design perspective [@odonnell2000]
1. Information systems give interaction and feedback
2. Type of presentation format to be used
3. Differences in the amount of information load.

Information load is essential, as dashboards must provide the right decision cues without overwhelming the user with excess information.

\db{"A decision cue is a feature of something perceived that is used in the interpretation of perception" [@choo2009],  where perception is an inferential process as objects in the environment can only be perceived indirectly through available information that has been sensed by the individual [@brunswik1952].}

\db{Visual complexity and information utility are required. 
Visual complexity refers to the "degree of difficulty in providing a verbal description of an image ([@heaps1999], [@olivia2004]).}

- Graphs are more suitable for spatial tasks (ex., for comparing a set of values) [@vessey1991];[@umanath1994];[@vessey1994]
- Graphs reduced the negative influence of information overload
- Graphs produced better correlation estimates and decreased time on a task [@schulzand];[@booth2006]
- Self-organizing maps and multidimensional scaling did not significantly outperform tabular representations [@huang2006]

The purposes of a dashboard:

1. Consistency
2. Monitoring
3. Planning
4. Communication

\db{Card stated "Use interactive visual representations of abstract, non-physically based data to amplify cognition." [@card1999]}

\db{Visual perception involves two elements - the perceptual and conceptual gist. 
The perceptual gist refers to the process of the brain when it determines the image properties that provide the structural representation of a scene, like color and texture. 
The conceptual gist refers to the scene's meaning, which is improved after the perceptual information is received ([@friedman1979]; [@olivia2004]).}

\db{Visual complexity might increase with the quality and range of objects and with varying material and surface styles [@heylighen1997].}

\db{Repetitive and uniform patterns and existing knowledge of the objects in the scene reduce visual complexity [@olivia2004].}

\db{If the guidelines on our visual information load can be related to statistical terminology, we can consider this the fisher information of visual information load. 
This load can be used as a metric for balancing the amount of information rather than overloading the consumer.}

Visual Data Mining

\db{For data mining to be effective, it is important to include humans in the data exploration process and combine the flexibility, creativity, and general knowledge of the computational power of today's computers. 
Visual data exploration aims at integrating humans in the data exploration process, applying their perceptual abilities to the large data sets available in today's computer systems [@kiem2002].}

The visual data exploration process can be seen as a hypothesis generation process:

- The visualizations of the data allow the user to gain insight into the data and come up with new hypotheses
- Along with verification of the hypotheses

The main advantages of visual data exploration over automatic data mining techniques from statistics or machine learning are:

- visual data exploration can efficiently deal with highly inhomogeneous and noisy data.
- visual data exploration is intuitive and requires no understanding of complex mathematical or statistical algorithms or parameters.

\db{Visual Exploration Paradigm, also known as MGV (Massive Graph Visualizer), is an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multidigraph navigation [@abello2002]. 
MGV usually follows a three-step process:}

- overview first
- zoom and filter
- details-on-demand

\db{The user identifies interesting patterns and focuses on one or more of them. Note that visualization technology does not only provide the base visualization techniques for all three steps but also bridges the gap between the steps.}

Visualization Technique Classification:

- Standard 2D/3D displays such as bar charts and x-y plots
- Geometrically transformed displays, such as landscapes and parallel coordinates, as used in a scalable framework
- Icon-based displays such as needle icons and star icons as used in MGV
- Dense pixel displays such as the recursive pattern and circle segments techniques and the graph sketches as used in MGV
- Stacked displays, such as treemaps or dimensional stacking

Interaction and distortion techniques allow users to interact directly with the visualizations.

- Projection as used in the Grand Tour System
- Filtering as used in Polaris
- Zooming as used in MGV and scalable framework
- Linking and Brushing as used in Polaris and the scalable framework

Design Theory in Information System

The knowledge is distinguished as the fifth of five types of theory:

1. Analyzing & describing
2. Understanding
3. Predicting
4. Explaining and predicting 
5. Design and action

\db{A definition of information systems that are suitable for our purposes concerns: "the effective design delivery use and impact of information technology in organizations and society [@avison1995]. }

The two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information systems discipline:

 - *Behavioral Science Paradigm* - seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior (roots in natural science research methods).
 - *Data Science Paradigm* - seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts (roots in engineering and the sciences of the artificial) [@simon1996].
 
\db{Technology and behavior are not dichotomous in an information system. They are inseparable [@lee2000]. Information technology (IT) artifacts are broadly defined as:}
 
 - constructs (vocabulary & symbols)
 - models (abstractions & representations)
 - methods (algorithms & practices)
 - instantiations  (implemented & prototype systems)
 
\db{These are concrete prescriptions that enable IT researchers and practitioners to understand and address the problems inherent in developing and successfully implementing information systems within organizations ([@march1995]; [@nunamaker1991]). }


Researchers have used PCPs to visualize categorical data. 
Beygelzimer, Perng, Ma and Hellerstien created a fast ordering categorical data analysis algorithm that helped visualization, where their algorithms helped organize the original parallel coordinate plots clearer ([@beygelzimer2001]; [@ma2001]). 
Hammock plots are modified versions of similar coordinate plots invented by Schonlau to visualize categorical data [@schonlau2003]. 
His design replaces coordinate polygons with rectangles to present the number. 
Treemaps are modified to support categorical data visualization.


\db{Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) analyzes and summarizes a dataset to discover patterns, trends, and insights. 
It is a crucial step in the data analysis process and is often used to identify which variables are essential, what the data looks like, and what the underlying structure of the data is. 
EDA is typically done using various techniques, such as visualizations, statistical summaries, and data transformations.}

<!-- \svp{You don't have to motivate your other papers here - that will come later. Focus on the essentials - describe the main pieces of work in the area you're trying to expound upon.} -->

<!-- Since we don't completely understand the way that basic statistical graphics are -->

<!-- When effectively adding advanced graphical representations to a naive user, what have we done to create a proper understanding of an engaging idea of what's going on? -->

<!--  
\svp{Start with a definition of what dashboards are. Maybe reference/quote Few? Key components - visualization, interactivity, update frequency, simplicity? (the last one is arguable). Transition to Exploratory Data Analysis by saying that one of the key ways dashboards are used is to allow people to explore the data, and that dashboards are particularly useful for non-experts, as they do not require writing code or understanding how to work with the underlying data. Reference Figure \ref{fig-design-map} in this paragraph.}

Mallows and Walley list psychology as one of four areas likely to support a theory of analysis @mallows1980. 
Data analyses rely on the mind's ability to learn, analyze, and understand. 

Visual inference uses our ability to detect graphical anomalies. 
However, the idea of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with one exception: The test statistic is now a graphical display compared to a “reference distribution” of plots showing the null.

Data Scientists and other analytic professionals often use interactive visualization in the dissemination phase at the end of a workflow, during which findings are communicated to a wider audience. 
Digital tools are critical to data science and analytics workflows, and current practice spans the following:

- *Data Analysis Tools* - R, Pandas and SAS
- *Data Warehousing Services* - MySQL, MongoDB, or Amazon Redshift
- *Machine Learning Libraries* - scikit-learn o Apache MLlib

A typical process typically consists of the following general stages:

1. *Discovery*: Formulating an exciting question and determining the data necessary to answer it.
2. *Acquisition*: Locating, organizing, and preparing data to be accessible to the chosen analysis environment.
3. *Exploration*: Investigating and analyzing the data set to collect insights and understand the data
4. *Modeling*: Building fitting and validating a model that can explain the data set and the observed phenomena
5. *Communication*: Disseminating the results to stakeholders in reports, presentations, and charts.

### Variable Types

Not all variables should be used to create all types of charts - variable type informs chart structure
\db{
Categorical Data Visualization is the process of visualizing data that can be divided into distinct categories or groups. Categorical data are non-numeric and often represented by words, labels, or symbols, such as gender, product type, color, etc.}

\db{Visualizing categorical data helps uncover patterns and relationships between categories and can provide insights into the data distribution. 
Categorical data visualization techniques include bar charts, pie charts, histograms, stacked bar charts, and others. 
The choice of visual representation will depend on the data's nature and the insights being sought. 
The goal of categorical data visualization is to communicate the information effectively and make it easier to understand and interpret.}

\db{CatTree gives a hierarchical categorical data visualization with interaction [@kolatch2001]. 
Fernstad developed an interactive system combining parallel coordinates, tables, and scatterplot matrices for an overview explorative analysis. 
Thoroughly research categorical data visualization to support algorithm understanding. 
The novel contingency wheel presented by [@alsallakh2011] supports visual analytics in categorical data, and he measured association based on Pearson's residuals and used visual abstraction based on elements frequency.}

\db{High-Dimensional Data Visualization represents complex data sets with many variables or features (also known as high-dimensional data). 
The goal is to find effective ways to express such data in a form that allows easy understanding, analysis, and interpretation.
This is typically achieved by reducing the dimensionality of the data, for example, by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space or by aggregating the data in some way. 
The resulting visualizations can then reveal patterns, relationships, and other insights that would otherwise be difficult to detect from the raw data. 
For example, high-dimensional data visualization techniques include scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots, heat maps, and many others.}

\db{A popular research area in visualization since high-dimensional data is always fuzzy to mining. 
Direct visualization includes geometric visualizations:}

- scatterplots: use dots in coordinate to present data points.
- parallel coordinates: present each dimension as axes, and every data item intersects dimensions as a polygon line at a particular position
- RadViz/ PolyViz
- GridViz

\db{Besides these traditional geometric visualization methods, iconographic displays like human faces and star glyphs used funny ways to present multivariate data. 
Hierarchical methods are used widely in parallel coordinates, which give analysts an intuitive view of clustering information [@fua1999]; [@johansson2005]. 
Rearrange the dimensions by dimension similarity on parallel coordinates, circle segments, and recursive patterns [@ankerst1998]. 
Guo used an interactive feature selection method to help users identify interesting subspaces from high-dimensional data sets [@guo2003].}

\db{Visualizations have become more effective in recent years due to the pandemic and the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard [@JHPHDashboard] [Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).
We were glued to our computers, TVs, and phones for most of the world. 
As a result, we watched the dashboard change in real-time to adapt to the users' needs. 
In part to data growth and changing, the dashboard, as well as the visualizations, were needed in a condensed platform. 
The need to be concise and vastly informative is a struggle regarding data visualizations. }

\db{Interactive visualization is a commonly used tool in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is the initial step in the data analysis process. 
The goal of EDA is to gain a high-level understanding of the data and to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data. }

The space of infographics has been a much better way of looking at data on a creative scale.[@stat\_graph\_hist] 
While this may be a way of seeing the data in a friendly way, infographics need to include an interactive piece of data that many people would like to explore.

### Multivariate Data Displays

- Difficulty of visualizing multivariate data
- Different approaches - briefly mention 
    - encoding with shape/color/etc.
    - tours
    - pcps
    - linked graphics (interactivity)

This section doesn't need to solve the problem - it just introduces it

Several methods can be used to conduct user analysis:

- Interviews: This involves conducting in-depth interviews with users to understand their needs, goals, and workflows.
- Surveys involve sending out surveys to users to gather data on their needs and preferences.
- Observations: This involves observing users as they complete tasks with the interface to understand their behaviors and workflows.
- Personas: This is a method of creating fictional characters that represent the different types of users; it helps to understand the users' needs and goals.
- Scenarios: This is a method of creating stories that describe how a user might interact with a system; it helps to understand the context and the user's needs.
- Focus groups: This is a method of gathering a small group of users and facilitating a discussion to understand the users' needs and goals.
- Contextual inquiry: This is a method of visiting the users in their work environment and observing them while they work; it helps to understand the context and the user's needs.



Several protocols and methods can be used to test the design of a dashboard or other visual display. 
Some of these include:

- Usability testing: This involves having users interact with the dashboard and providing feedback on its usability, including how easy it is to navigate, understand, and use.
- Cognitive walkthrough: This involves having experts in human-computer interaction evaluate the dashboard, focusing on the cognitive processes required to use it effectively.
- Eye-tracking: This involves using technology to track the users' gaze and interactions, to understand the user's focus and attention on the dashboard elements.
- A/B testing: This involves creating two versions of the dashboard, each with slightly different design elements, and comparing the results to see which design is more effective.
- Surveys: This involves asking users to complete a survey that measures their satisfaction and understanding of the dashboard and to provide feedback on improvements.
- Heat maps: This involves using heat maps to track where users are clicking on the dashboard to identify which elements are being used the most and which are being ignored.
- Card sorting: This is a method to understand the users' mental models and how they would like to organize and categorize the data; it is helpful to understand how to structure the dashboard navigation.


# Testing Graphics 
\db{These are just a few examples of the many protocols and methods that can be used to test the design of a dashboard. 
The selection of the appropriate way will depend on the specific goals of the testing and the resources available. 
Remember that the user's feedback is crucial in the testing process; it will provide the necessary insight to improve the design and make it more efficient.}


Overview of testing methods for interactive graphics - talk aloud, measuring user engagement, etc.
\db{Testing interactive graphics using human perception principles in psychology involves considering various aspects of human perception and cognition to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of the graphics. 
Here are some steps you can follow to test your interactive graphics:}

\db{Usability testing: Conduct a usability test to assess the ease of use and accessibility of the graphics. 
This includes testing for navigation, user control, and overall user experience.}

\db{Perception of visual elements: Evaluate how the visual elements in your graphics, such as color, contrast, size, and position, impact the perception of the information being presented.}

\db{Cognitive load: Assess the cognitive load on the user by evaluating how easily they can process and understand the information being presented. Factors such as complexity, amount of information, and type of information presented can impact cognitive load.}

\db{Attention allocation: Observe where the user's attention is directed while interacting with the graphics. This can help identify areas that may require improvement or modification to better engage the user's attention.}

\db{Memory retention: Evaluate the user's ability to retain and recall information presented in the graphics. This can help determine the effectiveness of the design in supporting memory retention.}

\db{User feedback: Obtain user feedback through surveys, interviews, or focus groups to gain insights into the user experience and identify areas for improvement.}

\db{It is important to keep in mind that human perception and cognition can vary greatly between individuals and can be influenced by a range of factors, such as age, culture, and personal experience. Testing with a representative sample of your target audience can help ensure that your interactive graphics are optimized for a wide range of users.}


\db{EDA refers to methods and procedures for exploring the data space to learn about a data set. 
By analogy, exploratory modeling analysis (EMA) refers to methods and procedures for exploring the space of models which may be fit to a data set.}

- PCPs enable the display of multi-dimensional data in two-dimensional space.
- There must be some loss of information, but this can be partly counteracted by varying the order of the axes.
- Interactivity is valuable for reordering the axes flexibly and fast.
- Interaction is valuable for dealing with the dense mass of lines produced by large data sets.

\db{Being able to select subgroups of cases, highlight the chosen lines, and switch between different subgroups all assist in interpreting the otherwise intricate displays which arise.}

<!-- This is a bit trite - let's come back to it and figure out how to not make it sound like the statistic equivalent of "since the beginning of time".  -->
<!--As tabular data grows in our society, it has pushed our need to create visualizations that represent that data in a correct and digestible way. -->


<!-- The work appears how many times in this sentence? --> 
<!-- The work that has been done in statistical graphics research would suggest that the work that is done in this work has grown increasingly formal, adding sound guidelines with statistically sound metrics that are needed. -->
<!-- I'm not sure what this is saying, exactly. In plain language, what's the goal? -->
<!-- This work has been explored in various disciplines but not in statistical graphics. -->
<!-- Starting with a definition of a dashboard (or even a motivating example, like a famous COVID dashboard?) might be an easier way to introduce this -->
<!-- We know that dashboards are visual information tools with multiple statistical pictures. -->
<!-- We should consider the fact that we may need to consider? You're showing you're an expert here - quit hedging! You know your stuff, so make definitive statements. Example:
As dashboards are intended to facilitate exploration of and drawing conclusions from data, we need to design dashboards that represent and model the data accurately, but it is also important to consider how the intended audience will be able to interact with the dashboard and perceive the visual elements. -->
<!-- Thus, we should consider the fact that we may need to consider the statistical and psychological framework in a dashboard that will combine multiple statistical graphics. -->
<!-- You haven't defined dashboards yet -->

<!-- One graphic can be misleading alone, but can two graphics be considered misleading when placing two "correctly" designed graphics together on a dashboard?  -->
<!-- This is something that visual information researchers explore but don't test.  -->
<!-- This is a good point, but is it something we're going to explore? If not, let's focus on whether charts which are used by statisticians are good for general audiences. We can first talk about the naive design of the dashboard and the revisions in Ch. 2, then we can talk about ggflower in Ch. 3, then making PCPs interactive in Ch. 4-->

<!-- A collaboration is when two or more entities work together to produce a desired and shared outcome.  -->
<!-- Interdisciplinary research with collaboration is a pinnacle aspect of dashboards and statistical graphics to produce innovation and scientific knowledge. -->

<!-- Interactive graphics and dashboards can be created using various programming languages and libraries such as Python (with libraries like Plotly, Bokeh, and Dash), R (with libraries like Shiny), JavaScript (with libraries like D3.js and Highcharts), and many more.  -->
<!-- These libraries allow you to create visualizations and dashboards that can be easily interacted with, such as zoom, hover, pan, and other features. Many data visualization platforms, such as Tableau and Power BI, provide drag-and-drop interfaces for creating interactive graphics and dashboards without coding. -->

<!-- #### Characteristics of Big Data -->
<!-- \begin{center} -->
<!-- \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/BigDataDiagram.png} -->
<!-- \captionof{figure}{Big Data Diagram} -->
<!-- \end{center} -->

<!-- The Big Data Diagram will display the three main features and characteristics of big data: -->
<!-- - Volume: is its size and how enormous it is -->
<!-- - Variety: includes the different formats and types of data, as well as the different kinds of uses and ways of analyzing the data -->
<!-- - Velocity: refers to the rate with which data is changing or how often it is created -->


<!-- #### Big Data Storage and Management -->
<!-- \svp{I really hope we don't have to get into data lakes/warehouses/etc. for this work...} -->

<!-- We can't discuss big data analytics without discussing data storage and management. Our tasks with big data storage is to determine where and how this data will be stored once it is acquired: -->
<!-- - Traditional structured data storage and retrieval methods include relational databases, data marts, and data warehouses. -->
<!-- - Uploaded to the storage from operational data stores using: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) tools which extract data from outside sources, transform the data to fit operational needs, and transform and cataloged before made available for data mining and online analytical functions. -->

<!-- Given the growing numbers of data sources and the sophistication of data analyses, big data storage should allow analysts to produce and adapt data rapidly. -->

<!-- - This requires an agile database whose current data analyses use complex statistical methods, and analysts need to be able to be deep and serve as a sophisticated algorithmic run time engine. -->


<!-- ## History/Review of Graphical Representation -->
<!-- \svp{I think you're going to want to reformat this and not focus so much on history, instead focus on how we choose a specific graphical representation, the advantages/disadvantages of those representations, and the user factors which weigh in.} -->

<!-- ### History/Origin of Statistical Visualization -->

<!-- Visualization is NOT prediction. Much of the field is focus on prediction models but big data analytics visualization is an important part of working to develop methodology for helping analysts to explore and understand what patterns are presented.  -->

<!-- > The data from plots can be very different from what would be learned by modeling and prediction which means both types of summarization are equally important. -->



<!-- Tasks can be viewed either by the goal the user is trying to obtain or by the intent the user has  -->

<!-- \captionof{figure}{10 Type Tasks with Sources} -->
<!-- \end{center} -->

<!-- Interaction of Type Tasks facilitate data exploration leading to the generation of new insights. Interactions explicitly place humans in the loop where visualizations leverage the human perceptual system reducing the cognitive load required for data analysis ([@endert2015], [@sedig2012]). More systems are using interactive visualizations, as opposed to static visualizations, which in turn requires a strong need to fully understanding the effectiveness of interaction techniques [@saket2018]. -->

<!-- \svp{Not for this particular write-up, but have you analyzed this to see if it's an effective visualization in its own right? I think this might be better as a table with boxes filled in or something?} -->


<!-- ### Applications -->

<!-- Two general applications in areas of visual inference have developed since the work of [@buja2009]. These applications are actual methodology and methodology based on protocols.  Actual methodology applications are used with alternative and corresponding null hypotheses, which perform visual inference tests to show many participants of different backgrounds with lineups. -->

## `ggpcp` package - Generalized Parallel Coordinate Plots

## Parallel Coordinate Plot Visualization Review

Parallel coordinate plots have been implemented in analysis software since the mid-1980s ([@Inselberg], [@Wegman]). Parallel Coordinate Plot Visualization, also called parallel plot, is an established field of high dimensional visualization of XY coordinate analysis. Parallel coordinate plots have a unique structure that will allow for data structures with n-dimensions. As data grows in exploratory data analysis, data visualizations will be more critical and valuable to understanding the underlying structures of valid data for analyses. Several packages in R are dedicated to visualizing parallel coordinate plots.

Dashboards can help understand and support many data types in essential business objectives. There are many different ways to label and utilize dashboards into different types.

Dashboards are cognitive tools that should be used to improve understanding of data, which should help people visually find relationships, trends, patterns, and outliers. Most importantly, dashboards should leverage people's visual cognitive capabilities.

### Parallel Coordinates in EDA
EDA refers to methods and procedures for exploring the data space to learn about a data set. By analogy, exploratory modeling analysis (EMA) refers to methods and procedures for exploring the space of models which may be fit to a data set.

Interactive graphics are excellent for EDA, they are designed for exploring rather than presenting information (and more) and can be obtained by directly querying the graphic [@unwin2003].

- PCPs enable the display of multi-dimensional data in two-dimensional space.
- There must be some loss of information, but this can be partly counteracted by varying the order of the axes.
- Interactivity is valuable for reordering the axes flexibly and fast.
- Interaction is valuable for dealing with the dense mass of lines produced by large data sets.

Being able to select subgroups of cases, highlight the selected lines, and switch between different subgroups all assist in interpreting the otherwise intricate displays which arise.


### R Packages

R packages exist for Parallel coordinate plots, with some built-in functionality, but only a few exist for advanced exploratory data analysis visualizations. Beginning with base plot package `parcoord` developed in MASS by [@Venables and Ripley 2004]. The package is limited by extensive, which contains more than methods for the parallel coordinate plot visualization. It contains the following tools for 2D visualization of PCPs. Another package, `gclus` was developed by [@Hurley] and implements `cparcoord` to include panel color of the strength of a correlation between neighboring axes.

While base R packages are helpful, a few packages within the ggplot2 environment implement parallel coordinate plots. With ggplot2 extension packages, the theory of grammar of graphics is at the focal point of plots. The following packages [@ggally] and `ggpcp` are built with the fundamental guidelines for graphic literacy for numeric variables. `GGally` was initially designed for the following pieces of graphic design: [LIST THE PACKAGE'S STARTING PLANS](), so it also contains much more capabilities for PCPs in addition to visualizations. `ggpcp` we separate the data transformations from the visualization, i.e., rather than working with a single function to draw a plot, we are providing a set of functions that work together [@ggpcp].

`ggparallel` implements and combines different types of parallel coordinate plots for categorical data: hammock plots, parallel sets plots, typical angle plots, and typical angle plots with a hammock-like adjustment for line widths [@Heike2013].


### `ggpcp` package importance

As mentioned in previous sections, that parallel coordinate plots have a long line history. However, we are now looking to incorporate the use of categorical data. The `ggpcp` implements the Grammar of graphics and the principled manner of categorical variables. This package separates the data managing part from the plots by giving full user access while keeping the number of parameters manageable. [@ggpcp]

While the `ggpcp` package is the first iteration of the package that can be changed in a way that will allow the user to rearrange the variables on the y-axis, this use can be helpful so that someone will be able to understand better. When we look at graphics through the eyes of someone that is not used to a graphic, we can see the usefulness and effectiveness of allowing more interaction from the user. This consideration is one that will be exhausted in my work. We will explore how one level of interaction from the user can create a better plot for understanding.-->
