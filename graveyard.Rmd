\db{In general, density plots represent the distribution of continuous variables, while categorical plots represent the distribution of categorical or discrete variables.
The interpretation of density plots typically involves understanding the shape of the distribution and the presence of any outliers or skewness. 
On the other hand, categorical plots aim to show the frequency or count of observations in each category.}

\db{When comparing density plots and categorical plots, it's essential to consider the data analysis type. 
For continuous data, a density plot may provide a more informative representation of the distribution. 
A categorical plot may provide a more intuitive representation of the distribution of categorical data.}

\db{However, for various reasons, some people may prefer one type of plot over the other. 
For example, some may find density plots more visually appealing, while others may prefer categorical plots for their simplicity and ease of interpretation. 
Ultimately, the choice between the two types of plots will depend on the context and purpose of the analysis and the preferences of the individual interpreting the data.}

\db{Do we comprehend why we utilize the graphics we do? 
Is there a reason we adopt the perception of a previously used graphic? 
How do we determine whether there are superior graphical representations when the human brain has determined that this is what I comprehend? 
How do we develop statistical methodologies based on effective testing of statistical graphics on human perceptions of excellent and good? 
How do we determine the line distinguishing a density plot from a categorical plot? 
Consequently, how is this decision made outside of academia and research? 
In one way, research has been conducted on the visual or human perception of categorical plots.}

\db{In addition to graphical elements alongside numerical values and plots such as Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs). 
We wish to discuss and analyze the exploration of using didn't report plots or categorical plots as density plots in the field. 
We will analyze statistical data and graphics alongside dashboard design, starting with Steven Few's whites. 
It would be worthwhile to investigate the development of dashboards from static graphical representations in a practical setting to dynamic representations in an application setting. 
This is the application of research to practice.}

\db{What may be considered an exciting thought process in research that is less practical or useful in the field? 
For example, in sports, many coaches desire printable diagrams containing all necessary and valuable information on a single page. 
As data in sports becomes more prominent, extensive, and collected, this information must be refined. 
We will adopt the concept of dynamically introducing the application to stakeholders with a static representation and migrating them into an active application. 
Once this dynamic application is utilized or migrated to that space, it is necessary to comprehend why categorical representations are more critical than density representations in the field. 
We're speaking about the same data being represented. 
However, most of the data is then categorized. 
Is it because categorical shot charts in tables are perceived to be digestible or because density plots become cluttered and difficult to comprehend? 
Where do we draw the line between what is viewed as an impediment to the development of applicable graphics methodology?}

\db{Subject matter graphics are visual representations of information and data that help communicate complex concepts, ideas, and information to audiences.
This expertise is related to knowledge of the topic or subject being presented in the graphic.
A subject matter expert is someone who has a deep understanding of how people perceive and interpret visual information. 
Subject matter experts (SMEs) have deep knowledge and experience in a specific field, such as science, finance, or medicine. 
SMEs provide the necessary information and insights to form the graphic's basis. 
They ensure that the content presented is accurate, relevant, and informative. 
They use their human perception and cognition knowledge to design graphics that effectively communicate information to the intended audience. 
Perception experts in graphics consider a range of factors, including color, shape, size, texture, and spatial relationships, to create graphics that are visually appealing and easy to understand.}

\db{Perception experts in graphics may use different theories and principles to inform their design decisions. 
For example, they may use Gestalt principles to create visually harmonious and organized graphics. 
They may also use the principles of visual hierarchy to guide the audience's attention to the essential information in the graphic.}

\db{Perception experts in graphics may also conduct user research to understand how different audiences perceive and interpret visual information. 
They may use eye-tracking and user testing techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of different graphic designs.}

\db{A perception expert plays a crucial role in designing graphics that effectively communicate information to the intended audience. 
Their knowledge of human perception and cognition, as well as their expertise in graphic design, allows them to create visually appealing and easily understood graphics.}

\db{Visualizing Complex Data is representing complex, multi-dimensional data in a graphical or pictorial form to make it easier to understand and interpret. 
The goal is to turn large, intricate data sets into visually appealing and intuitive representations, such as charts, graphs, maps, and other types of visualizations, to help identify patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be immediately apparent from raw data. 
This process can help to communicate complex information effectively and make data-driven decisions.}


William Cleveland's subcycle plots:

- glyph maps and binned graphics emerging from big data visualization efforts.
- glyphs and other plots have been embedded in maps 

<!-- How do we classify charts? -->
Bertin's Semiologic of Graphics is a seminal work in the academic study of visualization. 
[@schulz2013] define two abstractions for the design of visualizations:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
  Data + Task = Visualization \\
  Data + Visualization = Task
\end{align*}
\end{center}

\db{These abstractions demonstrate dependence between the data, visual representation, and the task. 
The more the user interacts with the visualization, they gain knowledge. 
The interactions allow the user to control their understanding by providing the flexibility to create new views that help them go beyond just the visual representation [@kiem2008]. 
The field of information visualization is continually adapting to changes with the big data revolution.}

\db{Data Scientists and Statisticians have produced more graphics since the pandemic's start. 
The reasons someone will create a graphic or dashboard may include but are not limited to understanding raw data structures to analyze model assumptions and present predictions, along with displaying key performance metrics of business logic. 
These goals help work to navigate and are best served by quick-and-dirty representations of the data, while highly polished graphics may be more useful in other situations. 
It is valuable and essential to convey data correctly, meaning that we need to understand how graphics are perceived on a dashboard on a general level. Previous research by Tukey focused on graphics as a tool for exploratory analysis. 
Tukey describes in Exploratory Data Analysis [@tukey1966] that pictures are often used to display data in a more enhanced version than a table. 
Tukey outlines detailed the types of different graphics and in which situations to utilize these graphics. 
The article - "External cognition: how do graphical representations work?" by Scaife and Rogers [@scaife1996] critique the disparate literature on graphical representations, focusing on four representative studies. 
In general, this will help in the psychology of the perceptual experience.}


\db{The visual reference model developed by Card et al. [@Card] describes and identifies the three phases of the visualization process.}

```{r graphics, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%",fig.cap='Visual Reference model by Card',fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/VizModelDiagram.png")
```

\db{While External Cognition describes the advances in graphical technology and how little had been done in the work of the cognitive framework of the discipline, the following citations by Ware attempt to develop the necessary guidelines that are useful for the work done by the perceptual experience.}

Colin Ware "Information Visualization: Perception for Design" [@Ware2004] there are four stages of visualization

- The collection and storage of data itself
- The preprocessing design to transform the data into something we can understand
- The display hardware and the graphics algorithms produce the image on the screen.
- The human perceptual and cognitive system


\db{The overlapping understanding in the field, while Ware takes the process one step further not just to allow the end user to understand the outcomes but to curate the outcomes with a visual perception of the data that makes the cognitive load easier for the end-user.}

\db{A dashboard has much information related to tabular data from multiple sources. 
Design should be recorded a produced with content that will allow for reproducibility. 
A dashboard should have some content related to interaction with the user. 
This interaction can be in multiple forms: toggling through the selection of variables to display uniformly to the use of interaction on the graph and allowing a user to understand best what is being shown in the diagram.}

\db{The entire dashboard/Interface should have a human perception piece that is useful for the user to comprehend and use. 
For example, the dashboard/interface could be more practical if the user is visually overwhelmed.}

- Identified the highly relevant from a dashboard design perspective [@odonnell2000]
1. Information systems give interaction and feedback
2. Type of presentation format to be used
3. Differences in the amount of information load.

Information load is essential, as dashboards must provide the right decision cues without overwhelming the user with excess information.

\db{"A decision cue is a feature of something perceived that is used in the interpretation of perception" [@choo2009],  where perception is an inferential process as objects in the environment can only be perceived indirectly through available information that has been sensed by the individual [@brunswik1952].}

\db{Visual complexity and information utility are required. 
Visual complexity refers to the "degree of difficulty in providing a verbal description of an image ([@heaps1999], [@olivia2004]).}

- Graphs are more suitable for spatial tasks (ex., for comparing a set of values) [@vessey1991];[@umanath1994];[@vessey1994]
- Graphs reduced the negative influence of information overload
- Graphs produced better correlation estimates and decreased time on a task [@schulzand];[@booth2006]
- Self-organizing maps and multidimensional scaling did not significantly outperform tabular representations [@huang2006]

The purposes of a dashboard:

1. Consistency
2. Monitoring
3. Planning
4. Communication

\db{Card stated "Use interactive visual representations of abstract, non-physically based data to amplify cognition." [@card1999]}

\db{Visual perception involves two elements - the perceptual and conceptual gist. 
The perceptual gist refers to the process of the brain when it determines the image properties that provide the structural representation of a scene, like color and texture. 
The conceptual gist refers to the scene's meaning, which is improved after the perceptual information is received ([@friedman1979]; [@olivia2004]).}

\db{Visual complexity might increase with the quality and range of objects and with varying material and surface styles [@heylighen1997].}

\db{Repetitive and uniform patterns and existing knowledge of the objects in the scene reduce visual complexity [@olivia2004].}

\db{If the guidelines on our visual information load can be related to statistical terminology, we can consider this the fisher information of visual information load. 
This load can be used as a metric for balancing the amount of information rather than overloading the consumer.}

Visual Data Mining

\db{For data mining to be effective, it is important to include humans in the data exploration process and combine the flexibility, creativity, and general knowledge of the computational power of today's computers. 
Visual data exploration aims at integrating humans in the data exploration process, applying their perceptual abilities to the large data sets available in today's computer systems [@kiem2002].}

The visual data exploration process can be seen as a hypothesis generation process:

- The visualizations of the data allow the user to gain insight into the data and come up with new hypotheses
- Along with verification of the hypotheses

The main advantages of visual data exploration over automatic data mining techniques from statistics or machine learning are:

- visual data exploration can efficiently deal with highly inhomogeneous and noisy data.
- visual data exploration is intuitive and requires no understanding of complex mathematical or statistical algorithms or parameters.

\db{Visual Exploration Paradigm, also known as MGV (Massive Graph Visualizer), is an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multidigraph navigation [@abello2002]. 
MGV usually follows a three-step process:}

- overview first
- zoom and filter
- details-on-demand

\db{The user identifies interesting patterns and focuses on one or more of them. Note that visualization technology does not only provide the base visualization techniques for all three steps but also bridges the gap between the steps.}

Visualization Technique Classification:

- Standard 2D/3D displays such as bar charts and x-y plots
- Geometrically transformed displays, such as landscapes and parallel coordinates, as used in a scalable framework
- Icon-based displays such as needle icons and star icons as used in MGV
- Dense pixel displays such as the recursive pattern and circle segments techniques and the graph sketches as used in MGV
- Stacked displays, such as treemaps or dimensional stacking

Interaction and distortion techniques allow users to interact directly with the visualizations.

- Projection as used in the Grand Tour System
- Filtering as used in Polaris
- Zooming as used in MGV and scalable framework
- Linking and Brushing as used in Polaris and the scalable framework

Design Theory in Information System

The knowledge is distinguished as the fifth of five types of theory:

1. Analyzing & describing
2. Understanding
3. Predicting
4. Explaining and predicting 
5. Design and action

\db{A definition of information systems that are suitable for our purposes concerns: "the effective design delivery use and impact of information technology in organizations and society [@avison1995]. }

The two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information systems discipline:

 - *Behavioral Science Paradigm* - seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior (roots in natural science research methods).
 - *Data Science Paradigm* - seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts (roots in engineering and the sciences of the artificial) [@simon1996].
 
\db{Technology and behavior are not dichotomous in an information system. They are inseparable [@lee2000]. Information technology (IT) artifacts are broadly defined as:}
 
 - constructs (vocabulary & symbols)
 - models (abstractions & representations)
 - methods (algorithms & practices)
 - instantiations  (implemented & prototype systems)
 
\db{These are concrete prescriptions that enable IT researchers and practitioners to understand and address the problems inherent in developing and successfully implementing information systems within organizations ([@march1995]; [@nunamaker1991]). }

Mallows and Walley list psychology as one of four areas likely to support a theory of analysis @mallows1980. 
Data analyses rely on the mind's ability to learn, analyze, and understand. 

Visual inference uses our ability to detect graphical anomalies. 
However, the idea of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with one exception: The test statistic is now a graphical display compared to a “reference distribution” of plots showing the null.

Data Scientists and other analytic professionals often use interactive visualization in the dissemination phase at the end of a workflow, during which findings are communicated to a wider audience. 
Digital tools are critical to data science and analytics workflows, and current practice spans the following:

- *Data Analysis Tools* - R, Pandas and SAS
- *Data Warehousing Services* - MySQL, MongoDB, or Amazon Redshift
- *Machine Learning Libraries* - scikit-learn o Apache MLlib

A typical process typically consists of the following general stages:

1. *Discovery*: Formulating an exciting question and determining the data necessary to answer it.
2. *Acquisition*: Locating, organizing, and preparing data to be accessible to the chosen analysis environment.
3. *Exploration*: Investigating and analyzing the data set to collect insights and understand the data
4. *Modeling*: Building fitting and validating a model that can explain the data set and the observed phenomena
5. *Communication*: Disseminating the results to stakeholders in reports, presentations, and charts.

<!-- Thus, we should consider the fact that we may need to consider the statistical and psychological framework in a dashboard that will combine multiple statistical graphics. -->

<!-- A collaboration is when two or more entities work together to produce a desired and shared outcome.  -->

<!-- #### Big Data Storage and Management -->
<!-- \svp{I really hope we don't have to get into data lakes/warehouses/etc. for this work...} -->

<!-- - Traditional structured data storage and retrieval methods include relational databases, data marts, and data warehouses. -->
<!-- - Uploaded to the storage from operational data stores using: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) tools which extract data from outside sources, transform the data to fit operational needs, and transform and cataloged before made available for data mining and online analytical functions. -->

<!-- Given the growing numbers of data sources and the sophistication of data analyses, big data storage should allow analysts to produce and adapt data rapidly. -->

<!-- - This requires an agile database whose current data analyses use complex statistical methods, and analysts need to be able to be deep and serve as a sophisticated algorithmic run time engine. -->

## `ggpcp` package - Generalized Parallel Coordinate Plots

## Parallel Coordinate Plot Visualization Review

Parallel coordinate plots have been implemented in analysis software since the mid-1980s ([@Inselberg], [@Wegman]). Parallel Coordinate Plot Visualization, also called parallel plot, is an established field of high dimensional visualization of XY coordinate analysis. Parallel coordinate plots have a unique structure that will allow for data structures with n-dimensions. As data grows in exploratory data analysis, data visualizations will be more critical and valuable to understanding the underlying structures of valid data for analyses. Several packages in R are dedicated to visualizing parallel coordinate plots.

Dashboards can help understand and support many data types in essential business objectives. There are many different ways to label and utilize dashboards into different types.

Dashboards are cognitive tools that should be used to improve understanding of data, which should help people visually find relationships, trends, patterns, and outliers. Most importantly, dashboards should leverage people's visual cognitive capabilities.

### Parallel Coordinates in EDA
EDA refers to methods and procedures for exploring the data space to learn about a data set. By analogy, exploratory modeling analysis (EMA) refers to methods and procedures for exploring the space of models which may be fit to a data set.

Interactive graphics are excellent for EDA, they are designed for exploring rather than presenting information (and more) and can be obtained by directly querying the graphic [@unwin2003].

- PCPs enable the display of multi-dimensional data in two-dimensional space.
- There must be some loss of information, but this can be partly counteracted by varying the order of the axes.
- Interactivity is valuable for reordering the axes flexibly and fast.
- Interaction is valuable for dealing with the dense mass of lines produced by large data sets.

Being able to select subgroups of cases, highlight the selected lines, and switch between different subgroups all assist in interpreting the otherwise intricate displays which arise.


### R Packages

R packages exist for Parallel coordinate plots, with some built-in functionality, but only a few exist for advanced exploratory data analysis visualizations. Beginning with base plot package `parcoord` developed in MASS by [@Venables and Ripley 2004]. The package is limited by extensive, which contains more than methods for the parallel coordinate plot visualization. It contains the following tools for 2D visualization of PCPs. Another package, `gclus` was developed by [@Hurley] and implements `cparcoord` to include panel color of the strength of a correlation between neighboring axes.

While base R packages are helpful, a few packages within the ggplot2 environment implement parallel coordinate plots. With ggplot2 extension packages, the theory of grammar of graphics is at the focal point of plots. The following packages [@ggally] and `ggpcp` are built with the fundamental guidelines for graphic literacy for numeric variables. `GGally` was initially designed for the following pieces of graphic design: [LIST THE PACKAGE'S STARTING PLANS](), so it also contains much more capabilities for PCPs in addition to visualizations. `ggpcp` we separate the data transformations from the visualization, i.e., rather than working with a single function to draw a plot, we are providing a set of functions that work together [@ggpcp].

`ggparallel` implements and combines different types of parallel coordinate plots for categorical data: hammock plots, parallel sets plots, typical angle plots, and typical angle plots with a hammock-like adjustment for line widths [@Heike2013].


### `ggpcp` package importance

As mentioned in previous sections, that parallel coordinate plots have a long line history. However, we are now looking to incorporate the use of categorical data. The `ggpcp` implements the Grammar of graphics and the principled manner of categorical variables. This package separates the data managing part from the plots by giving full user access while keeping the number of parameters manageable. [@ggpcp]

While the `ggpcp` package is the first iteration of the package that can be changed in a way that will allow the user to rearrange the variables on the y-axis, this use can be helpful so that someone will be able to understand better. When we look at graphics through the eyes of someone that is not used to a graphic, we can see the usefulness and effectiveness of allowing more interaction from the user. This consideration is one that will be exhausted in my work. We will explore how one level of interaction from the user can create a better plot for understanding.-->
