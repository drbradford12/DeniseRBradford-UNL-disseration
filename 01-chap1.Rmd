\section{ Visual Inference }

Visual inference uses our ability to detect graphical anomalies. The idea of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with one exception: The test statistic is now a graphical display which is compared to a “reference distribution” of plots showing the null.[REFERENCE WEBSITE]


Plots of data are important for exploratory data analysis (EDA) along with model diagnostics. Plots for EDA are a useful tool for guiding an analyst in discovering the relationships between variables in their data. In the case when using plots in model diagnostics, plots help analysts determine whether or not the model is appropriate way to model. During the initial EDA stage, an analyst may find that a variable or a covariate is directly related to the dependent variable when looking at a correlation heatmap or a scatterplot. This will be important to know before starting a linear model analysis.

\section{ History of Dashboard Design }

Dashboards can be used to help understand and support many types of data in any set of business objectives that are important. There are many different ways to label and utilize dashboards into different types. 

Dashboards are cognitive tools that should be used to improve understanding of data, which should help people visually find relationships, trends, patterns and outliers. Most importantly, dashboards should leverage people's visual cognitive capabilities. 



\subsection{ Formal Definitions }

Formally, a dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.[@few]. As dashboard has particular characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Achieve specific objectives
\item Fits on a single computer screen
\item Information can be displayed in multiple mediums (web browser or mobile device)
\item Can be used to monitor information at a high level
\end{itemize}

While a dashboard can be extremely useful, it may be worth describing that a poorly designed dashboard will not be used. A dashboard should be concise, clear, and intuitive when displaying components in combination of with a customized list of requirements of users.
