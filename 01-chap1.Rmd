\section{ History of Visual Inference }

Visual inference uses our ability to detect graphical anomalies. The idea of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with one exception: The test statistic is now a graphical display which is compared to a “reference distribution” of plots showing the null.[REFERENCE WEBSITE]


Plots of data are important for exploratory data analysis (EDA) along with model diagnostics. Plots for EDA are a useful tool for guiding an analyst in discovering the relationships between variables in their data. In the case when using plots in model diagnostics, plots help analysts determine whether or not the model is appropriate way to model. During the initial EDA stage, an analyst may find that a variable or a covariate is directly related to the dependent variable when looking at a correkation heatmap or a scatterplot. This will be important to know before starting a linear model analysis.
