\svp{I think it might be most effective to have several sub-sections of the lit review that are somewhat connected.}

First: Outline the general topic - creation of interactive graphics and dashboards to enable end-users to understand their own data. Explain that this is a highly interdisciplinary topic. Conclude this paragraph by explaining that you will explore the major sub-topics sequentially and then outline the interface between them at the end of the literature review.

- Graphics
    - Perceptual principles - cognitive load, working memory, etc.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Grammar of Graphics - with examples of code!
    - Big Data and graphical solutions - overplotting, binning, interactivity
    - Interactive Graphics

- Human Computer Interaction/UI-UX
    - User analysis - general process, not focused on your projects at all - you'll talk about that later on
    - Protocols for testing design - think aloud, eye tracking, feedback/surveys.
    - General Dashboard stuff

Conclusion: Connections between EDA and dashboards - not all dashboards are designed for EDA, but most dashboards are designed with end-users, not statisticians, in mind. This requires a different set of optimizations than if we designed for experts.

# Introduction
<!-- General purpose of this section: 
Motivate Dashboards and conclude that it is important to understand how graphs are perceived and used by various target audiences. -->

Statisticians use graphs in almost every stage of their work: we create charts when we get new data, to explore what we have and identify potential problems and opportunities. 
We fit models based on relationships between variables which are often identified visually. 
We identify problems with those models based on residual plots and other visual diagnostics. 
When our modeling work has been completed, we present our results to interested parties using visual displays, because non-statisticians often find it easier to understand data and models through an intuitive visual medium rather than through the mathematical formulae which underlie the statistical work.

Given the wide range of uses for graphs and visual data displays in statistical modeling, it is unsurprising that some graphs are more useful for specific applications such as exploratory analysis, and are unsuitable for other applications, such as presentation to an outside group.
In addition, we know that not all visual displays have equal perceptual value [@aspillaga1996]. 
The best graphics are designed to account for both the features of the dataset and the features of the intended audience.
Some design constraints stem from limitations of the human perceptual system and are common to most potential consumers of the visualization: the sine illusion [@vanderplas2015] affects anyone with binocular depth perception, and color recommendations are built around the specific characteristics of the human retina.
Other design constraints are due to the audience's experience level: are they used to working with data? 
Do they understand specialized techniques such as principal component analysis to the point where a plot of factor loadings might be \svp{a} useful \svp{visual display}?
When we create visualizations for public consumption we have to consider both perceptual factors and the target audience's domain knowledge.
In this introduction, we explore previous research related to the construction of interactive and static visual displays for different audiences and consider the implications of this research when designing interactive data displays such as dashboards.

\svp{Most research in statistical graphics has been done on static graphics; usually, research also strips away all but the most essential contextual information. 
As a result, it can be hard to generalize this research to practical applications, where the contextual information surrounding the data is critical and the chart does not just exist in a vacuum.}

\svp{In the "real world", however, conventions and familiarity often win out over best practice validated by perceptual experiments.}
For example, in sports, many coaches desire printable diagrams containing all necessary and valuable information on a single page. 
As data in sports becomes more prominent, extensive, and collected, this information must be refined. 

\svp{Thus, in addition to the experimental evidence, we must consider the human element: how to introduce new graphical concepts to stakeholders, and the considerations involved in encouraging stakeholders to adopt these improved graphics.}
\svp{Let us first consider the audience characteristics that affect the selection of graphics. 
Then, we will engage with considerations based on the data to be displayed. 
Finally, we will consider the interactions between the audience and the data: how graphics are tested, amended, and hopefully eventually adopted into common use.}


## Audience Considerations

Several factors, including perception, attention, and expertise, can influence our desire and ability to read and engage with data visualization.

Perception and attention are crucial cognitive processes that allow us to interpret and make sense of data visualizations. 
Perception refers to the manner in which we interpret and organize sensory information from our environment, whereas attention refers to the capacity to selectively focus on particular aspects of this information.

Our ability to perceive and pay attention to pertinent features, such as patterns, trends, and relationships, is essential for comprehending data visualizations. 
This is especially true when working with unfamiliar or complex data sets, as our ability to focus on pertinent information becomes more difficult.

In addition to perception and focus, domain-specific knowledge is essential for understanding and interacting with data visualizations. 
Expertise in a particular field can enable individuals to better interpret and comprehend the significance of the presented data, as well as identify potential biases or errors in the visualization.

In conclusion, the ability to perceive and interact with data visualizations requires a combination of perceptual and attentional processes, as well as domain-specific knowledge, in order to interpret and comprehend the presented information.

The term "data visualization" dates back to the 2nd century A.D. drawings and other visual representations were used to investigate the world and record historical events in ancient societies. 
Throughout human history, data visualization has significantly contributed to invention and discovery @Crapo2000.
The introduction of computer technology dramatically changed the visual representation of data. 
Using computer-based graphical data visualization, data analysts have become faster and more precise. 
Data visualization has become an integral component of research in numerous disciplines, such as algorithms, human perception, animation, computer vision, etc.
The origin of data visualization being a sub-category, it is regarded as "the science of the visual representation of data," @friendly2009.
"Data Visualization: a successful design process" defined data visualization as "the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities to amplify cognition," @kirk2012. 
This suggests that data visualization involves the exploitation of human visual perception in addition to the presentation of data.
Assigning meaning to visualization is not a statistical or computational step but a cognitive one. 
Each step in the data analysis process is part of a more extensive mental process.


### Perception

Human perception is an essential component of data visualization. 
Colin Ware suggests that perception can significantly enhance both the content and quantity of displayed information, @ware2012. 
Perception refers to the organization, interpretation, and conscious experience of sensory data.
Perception is also defined as "the process of recognizing (being aware of), organizing (gathering and storing), and interpreting (binding to knowledge) sensory information," @ward2010.
Ward et al. explain the notion of perception as the following:
> Simply put, perception is the process by which we interpret the world around us, forming a mental representation of the environment. This representation is not isomorphic to the world, but itâ€™s subject to many correspondence differences and errors. The brain makes assumptions about the world to overcome the inherent ambiguity in all sensory data, and in response to the task at hand. 

Human visual perception is a highly complex and subjective process, and the efficacy of a visualization in communicating objective understanding depends on a vast array of subtle factors, @reuter1990.
Furthermore, certain situations present unique challenges and lead to systematic errors; can these provide insight into how the brain solves the problem of which objects are represented by which images in general @gregory1968.
Additional to the general process of human visual perception process and efficacy of a visualization in communicating, short-term memory is crucial to the effectiveness of statistical graphics. 
Research indicates that our short-term memory can only store a limited amount of information at any given time. 
Therefore, designers must present data in a manner that is simple to comprehend and remember. 

Untrained analysts can and do "analyze" data with only their natural mental abilities - The mind performs its data analysis-like process to create detailed understandings of reality from bits of sensory input. 
In a later chapter, we will show how a utilizing parallel coordinate plot is one method for achieving a simple design to comprehend. 
These plots enable viewers to compare multiple variables concurrently, thereby reducing cognitive load and making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

<!--I need to close this section to introduce the principles of Gestalt and eye tracking-->
Examining the Gestalt principles, which describe how our brain organizes and interprets sensory information to form coherent patterns and objects, is one way to gain a deeper understanding of how perception functions.

### Gestalt Principles

Our visual interpretation of the world is a major factor in why humans perceive the world and its objects as organized, regular, and simple shapes, schemas, figures, or forms.
The theory of Gestalt has philosophical and psychological roots that date back to the late 1800s. 
Gestalt therapy is founded on the notion that overall perception is contingent upon the interaction of numerous factors.
These principles include proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, symmetry, and figure-ground relationships formally outlined in "Principles of Gestalt Psychology", @koffka1935. 

Gestalt principles include:

- Proximity: Objects close to each other are perceived as related or grouped.
- Similarity: Objects that are similar in some way (e.g., shape, color, size) are perceived as related or grouped.
- Continuation: The human eye follows lines and patterns, so designers can use this principle to guide the viewer's gaze through a display.
- Closure: The human brain tends to complete incomplete figures or patterns, so designers can use this principle to create the illusion of missing information.
- Figure-Ground: The human brain separates the foreground (figure) from the background (ground), so designers can use this principle to create visual hierarchy and emphasis.
- Contrast: The human eye is drawn to high-contrast areas, so designers can use this principle to create emphasis and hierarchy.
- Symmetry and Balance: The human eye finds symmetry and balance visually pleasing, so designers can use this principle to create a sense of harmony and order.

```{r gestalt, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.cap='Gestalt Principles with Examples',fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/gestalt_principles.png")
```


These principles are based on cognitive psychology and understanding how the human brain processes visual information. 
By applying these principles to dashboard design, designers can create visual arrangements that make it easier for viewers to understand the relationships between data elements. 
For example, proximity can be used to group related elements together, while symmetry can be used to create balance and harmony in the overall layout of the dashboard.
At its most basic, the entire form is perceived (or emerges to our visual pathways) as opposed to its component parts. 

All of this suggests that our brain frequently perceives things differently than what is actually present. 
If you are familiar with optical illusions or the famous "gorilla in the crowd" experiment, you are aware that we do not always process everything in our visual field. 
There is simply too much information for our brains to process, and if we tried to interpret it all, we would be rendered paralyzed.
We organize the world according to Gestalt principles and pre-attentive attributes so that it is familiar, makes sense, and is easy to process.
These principles guide how people perceive and make sense of the world around them, and they play a critical role in designing effective visual displays, such as dashboards.
Understanding the Gestalt principles can also cast light on how information is processed and stored in short-term memory and attention's critical role in this process.


### Attention and Memory

The Gestalt principles describe how humans perceive and organize visual information into meaningful patterns and structures to help the brain to effectively process and organize incoming visual information, making it easier to attend to and remember.
It's worth exploring the efficacy of short-term memory when developing effective dashboards.

Short-term memory (STM), also known as working memory, is the stage of temporary storage and processing where the majority of memory retention effort is expended. 
According to @baddeley2012, STM is a limited-capacity system prone to interference and decay. 
Selective attention is essential for the maintenance of STM because it allows us to filter out irrelevant information and concentrate on what is essential, @cowan2001.

Visual aids such as charts and diagrams can improve short-term memory by allowing us to encode and retain information more effectively, according to research, @alvarez2004.
Consequently, utilizing visual aids such as charts can be advantageous for enhancing our short-term memory.
Furthermore, annotations can also help aid short-term memory. 
By adding annotations, such as notes or highlights, to information we are trying to remember, we can improve our recall of the information later on, @alvarez2004.

<!-- Feature Integration Theory -->
According to the Feature Integration Theory (FIT), STM is composed of two stages: pre-attentive processing and focused attention @treisman1998. 
Parallel and independently, the brain processes the physical characteristics of an object, such as its color, shape, and orientation, during pre-attentive processing. 
However, focused attention is required to bind these features into a coherent object representation in STM.
STM can be improved through various strategies, such as rehearsal, chunking, and elaboration @oberauer2009. 
For example, by repeating a phone number several times or breaking it down into chunks of two or three digits, we can increase the likelihood of it being stored in STM. 
Similarly, by elaborating on the information we want to remember, such as creating mental associations or visual images, we can enhance its retention in STM @bui2014.

STM is a dynamic and malleable cognitive system that is crucial to our daily lives. 
Understanding the mechanisms underlying STM and how to improve it can have significant implications for learning, memory, and the treatment of memory disorders.
By analyzing the relationship between attention and working memory, we can gain insight into how we construct meaning from the information in our environment.

### Constructing Meaning

Gestalt psychology suggests that humans actively construct meaning by organizing information into patterns and wholes @wertheimer1938.
Both top-down and bottom-up processing are involved in the process of meaning construction. 
Bottom-up processing entails analyzing sensory data from the environment and constructing perceptions based on this data. 
Top-down processing is the influence of prior knowledge, expectations, and context on the perception and interpretation of incoming sensory data.

Together, top-down and bottom-up processing facilitate the encoding and retrieval of information in the context of short-term memory. 
Selective attention, the ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information, is an example of top-down processing that aids in the encoding and retrieval of information in short-term memory @cowan2010.  
According to the feature integration theory, the perception of objects involves both the bottom-up analysis of individual features and the top-down processing of higher-level features in order to form a complete perception @treisman1980.

The Gestalt principles of perception emphasize the significance of bottom-up and top-down processing in constructing meaning from sensory data. 
Both types of processing are involved in encoding and retrieving information, which has significant implications for understanding how short-term memory works.

### Expertise

However, creating effective graphics is not a simple task, and proficiency in this area is required to create high-quality visualizations. 
This essay will discuss the contributions to the field of graphics made by research on psychological processes, automaticity, readily available information, and practice effects.


**Cognitive Processes - the way we think about and approach a task.**

As we become more proficient in a particular skill, we develop more complex and efficient mental models or schemata, a heuristic technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. 
These mental models help us to organize information in a meaningful way, and to quickly identify and solve problems related to the task. 
This process is known as cognitive restructuring and is facilitated by developing domain-specific knowledge @ericsson1996. 
For example, a basketball coach is able to quickly recognize patterns and positions on a court that are common in basketball, which allows them to make decisions more quickly and accurately than a novice coach or player.


**Automaticity - the ability to perform a task without conscious effort or attention**

As our proficiency in a task increases, our performance becomes more automatic, thereby freeing up cognitive resources for other tasks.
The development of procedural knowledge, which is the ability to perform a series of steps or actions in a particular order, facilitates this process @fitts1967. 
For example, a well-trained quarterback can throw a ball without looking at the wide receiver because their throwing movements have become automatic.


**Information Readily Available - the way we process information related to a task**

As our proficiency increases, we can recognize and retrieve pertinent information more rapidly and precisely than a novice. 
This is made possible by the creation of domain-specific knowledge structures that allow us to retrieve pertinent information from memory quickly @chase1973. 
For example, a medical expert can quickly identify signs and diagnose a patient using their knowledge of disease symptoms and risk factors.


**Practice Effects - extensive practice and experience**

Practice effects are the performance enhancements that result from repeated practice. 
These gains are frequently most significant at the outset of practice, but gradually diminish as the individual approaches their performance ceiling @anderson1982. 
The development of procedural knowledge and automaticity, which allow for more efficient and accurate task performance, facilitates the effects of the practice.

The contributions of research on psychological processes, automaticity, readily available information, and practice effects to the field of graphics have significant implications. 
Expertise is required to create high-quality graphics, which requires a thorough understanding of design principles and the capacity to work quickly and efficiently. 
The use of automatic processing and domain-specific knowledge can aid designers in processing and deciding on design elements efficiently and quickly. 
The creation of standardized design templates, workflows, and other tools can aid in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the design process. 
Design skills can be improved through deliberate guidelines, and educators must focus on developing skills that can be applied in a variety of contexts.

As the significance of graphics in numerous fields continues to rise, the demand for specialists in this area will only intensify. 
By comprehending the contributions of research on psychological processes, automaticity, readily accessible information, and practice effects, designers, educators, and trainers can develop more effective approaches to graphics design and education. 
This can help ensure that the graphics used to convey complex information are clear, concise, and effective, making it easier for individuals to comprehend and interpret the required information.

### Engagement with the data
<!-- This is a good paragraph -- but I'm not sure it's in the right place.  -->
The goal of data analysis is to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and knowledge from data. 
The process of data analysis involves collecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data, followed by the use of statistical and machine learning methods to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. 
The end goal of data analysis is to support decision making and provide a basis for informed action. 
Data analysis can help organizations to better understand their customers, market trends, and operational performance. 
Additionally, data analysis can support scientific research by helping researchers to test hypotheses, develop theories, and gain a deeper understanding of complex phenomena. 
Ultimately, data analysis aims to turn data into actionable insights and information that can inform and improve decision-making.



## Data Considerations

John Tukey was the first to organize the collection and methods associated with philosophy into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
Previous research by Tukey focused on graphics as a tool for exploratory analysis. 
In "Exploratory Data Analysis," Tukey wrote that graphics and charts often display data more enhanced understanding than table @tukey1966. 
Tukey outlines detailed the types of different graphics and in which situations to utilize these graphics. 
John Tukey, creator of stem-and-leaf plot, boxplot-resistant smooth, and the violin plot (also known as rootgram) who taught us to utilize these methods to organize and demonstrate EDA. 
He was a strong advocate for the importance of EDA as a crucial first step in the data analysis process and emphasized the need for visualization and interactive techniques to understand patterns and relationships in data.

```{r violin_plot, echo=FALSE,out.width='.49\\linewidth', fig.width=3, fig.height=3, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x = Diet, y = weight)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Diet), trim = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p <- ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x=Diet, y=weight, fill=Diet)) +
  geom_boxplot()
p + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

Tukey's Principles in EDA:

1. Graphical exploration, looking for patterns or displaying fit, the method demonstrates things about data that a single numeric metric does not understand. 
This has been useful in graphing the data before you develop summary statistics.

2. Describing the general patterns of the data. 
This step should be insensitive to outliers. 
In general, think about the types of resistant measures (i.e., median or mean). 
This step is making sure to determine data patterns.

3. The natural scale/state that the data are at their best. 
This will be the step at which the scale of data can be helpful for analysis. 
The reexpressing data to a new scale by taking the square root or logarithmic scale.

4. The mostly known parts of EDA but is done in the way of accessing fit of the data. 
This is taught in every statistics 101 class. 
The growth of machine learning and prediction methods have now used residuals more in the toolbox to assessing the best prediction models.

The idea generally is to determine the deviations in the data from a general pattern by looking at the data from the fit of the data.

Visualizations of data are essential for exploratory data analysis (EDA) along with model diagnostics. 
Plots for EDA are a valuable tool for guiding an analyst in discovering the relationships between variables in their data. 
When using plots in model diagnostics, plots help analysts determine whether or not the model is an appropriate way to model. 
During the initial EDA stage, an analyst may find that a variable or a covariate is directly related to the dependent variable when looking at a correlation heatmap or a scatterplot. 
<!--This will be important to know before starting a linear model analysis. 
Much of our general understanding is from introductory statistics courses. -->
The basic understanding can be formalized to visualize the discovery process.

The field of graphical communication, which can is directly related to EDA, semiology, or the study of signs and symbols and their use in touch, has been a valuable tool and extension of the EDA thoughts that Tukey expressed.
One of the fundamental principles of semiology is the relationship between signifier and signified, in which a visual element (the signifier) represents a particular meaning or concept (the signified), @barthes1972. 
Another essential concept in semiology is using syntax and semantics to convey meaning in graphic communication effectively. 
This includes both the syntax and semantics of a graphic's visual elements, @bertin1983.

The use of color to represent data on maps is an example of successful graphical communication utilizing semiology. 
By using different colors to represent different data points, viewers can comprehend patterns and relationships in the data quickly and easily. 
Jacques Bertin  writes in "Semiology of Graphics" that color can be used to "emphasize a point, distinguish one category from another, or establish a relationship between two points", @bertin1983.
In addition, Bertin explains that the use of color can help overcome language barriers, making it easier for the audience to comprehend the presented information.

The application of semiology in graphical communication is not devoid of obstacles. 
One difficulty is the possibility of misinterpretation, in which viewers may assign a different meaning to a visual element than was intended, @bertin1983. 
Another concern is the possibility of cultural differences in interpretation, in which a visual element may have a different meaning in one culture versus another, @norman2013.

Despite these obstacles, semiology in graphical communication remains an indispensable tool for effectively conveying information. 
By understanding semiology principles and syntax and semantics' role in graphical communication, designers can create compelling visual representations that convey information clearly and concisely.

<!--Graphs are another tool that can be used to effectively communicate information via semiology. -->
By utilizing visual elements such as bars and lines to represent data, graphs can make complex information more understandable to viewers. 
For instance, a line graph can be used to illustrate the change in the value of a stock over time, making it easier for investors to identify trends and patterns. Leland Wilkinson writes in his book "The Grammar of Graphics" that "graphical methods are not only superior to other forms of communication, but also superior to numerical or verbal methods for certain types of data and reasoning,"@wilkinson2012.

It proposes that any statistical graphic can be broken down into a set of essential components, or "grammar," that can be combined in different ways to create a wide range of visualizations, following a layered approach to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner.

The components of the grammar of graphics include:

- Data: The raw data being visualized represents a set of observations or values. 
- Aesthetic Mappings: The mapping of data variables to visual properties such as position, color, shape, and size. 
- Scales: The mapping of data values to visual values, such as mapping a numerical value to a bar height. 
- Geometries: The basic shapes representing the data, such as points, lines, bars, and histograms.
- Facets: The plot division into multiple subplots, each representing a different subset of the data.

For example, a bar chart can be created by mapping a categorical variable to the x-axis, mapping a numerical variable to bar heights, and using rectangular bars as the geometry. 
For example, mapping two numerical variables can create a scatter plot to the x and y positions and use points as the geometry.
Finally, the Grammar of Graphics provides a systematic way of thinking about visualizations, making it easier to choose the appropriate visual representation for a given dataset.

```{r graphics2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "45%",fig.cap='Grammar of Graphics Diagram of Wickham and Wilkinson\'s work',fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("figure/gglayers.png")
#knitr::include_graphics("figure/graphic-flowchart.png")
knitr::include_graphics(rep(c("figure/gglayers.png","figure/graphic-flowchart.png"),1))
```


Michael Friendly has investigated the origins and development of graphic techniques, tracing their evolution from antiquity to the present. 
Friendly detailed using SAS with hands-on experiments to present categorical data analysis visually, @friendly2014.
By emphasizing the role of graphical methods in scientific discovery, Friendly has helped promote his use in various disciplines, from the natural sciences to the social sciences and beyond.
In his book "Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography, Statistical Graphics, and Data Visualization," Friendly provides a comprehensive overview of the key milestones in the evolution of statistical graphics, including the contributions of pioneers like William Playfair, Charles Minard, and John Tukey (@friendly2001).

<!--His historical research has yielded significant insights into the origins and evolution of graphical methods, while his development of new techniques has increased the number of data visualization tools available. -->

<!--### what do we know about "better" graphics for certain tasks? -->

As discussed regarding semiology, Tukey's Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and the introduction of the Grammar of Graphics, we should be mindful that a well-constructed graphic can be misleading out of context.
Compelling graphics can be a powerful tool for communicating complex information, making numerical accuracy, engagement, correct decision-making, and accurate predictions crucial. 

In the context of data visualization, numerical accuracy refers to the precision and correctness of the numerical data displayed in graphics. 
Accurate graphics can assist users in comprehending complex numerical data and making more informed decisions (@cardoso2016).

Engagement in the context of data visualization is the extent to which viewers are drawn to and interested in the displayed data. 
Engaging graphics can encourage users to interact with and explore data further, resulting in a more thorough comprehension of the data.

Correct decision making refers to the capacity of data visualization to enable users to make informed and precise decisions based on the presented information. 
Clear, accurate, and well-designed graphics can help users recognize patterns and insights, resulting in more effective decision making.

Correct predictions refers to the capability of graphics to accurately forecast or predict future events or outcomes. 
For accurate predictions, data visualization must include trustworthy data, sound statistical models, and efficient visualization techniques.

"Graphical Tests for Power Comparison of Competing Designs" by Hofmann et al. presents a graphical method for comparing the power of two or more competing designs in an experimental study @hofmann2012.
The article demonstrates that the graphical method is a useful tool for comparing the effectiveness of various experimental designs. 
It enables researchers to visualize and compare the effectiveness of different designs in an intuitive and straightforward manner.

Two methods for measuring the particle size distribution in a chemical process were compared in one study. 
The study evaluated both designs under various operating conditions and compared their power using a graphical method. 
The results demonstrated that one design was more effective at detecting differences in operating conditions than another.

Static Visualization is commonly used in the communication phase of data science workflows, and data scientists sometimes use them as part of the analysis. 
John Tukey's EDA methods are currently known and well-vetted in the field. 
However, Satyanarayan et. al began to address this by introducing a high-level grammar of graphics called "Vega-Lite," which presents a set of standardized linguistic rules for producing interactive information visualizations using a concise JSON format for data to be represented by the grammar [@satyanarayan2016]. 
Vega-Lite has been directly implemented in R via the `ggvis` package using the same - albeit slightly lower-level.

When designing visuals, it is essential to consider the cognitive load they may place on the viewer.
Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort required to process information, and minimizing it can enhance a graphic's effectiveness.
In addition, displaying as much raw data as possible while minimizing cognitive load can improve the graphic's clarity and precision.
Here are some general guidelines for making better graphics with works from (@few2012, @tufte1983, @cairo2016):

1. Keep it simple - Avoid overwhelming the viewer with too much information at once by employing a clear and concise design with minimal distractions.

2. Use visual hierarchy - Utilize size, color, contrast, and placement to highlight important information and direct the viewer's focus.

3. Choose appropriate charts - Choose the chart type that best illustrates the data and facilitates comprehension.

4. Label clearly - Use labels that are clear and concise for axes, legends, and other essential information to avoid confusion.

5. Use data-to-ink ratio - Focus on the data by minimizing the amount of non-data ink, such as decorative elements or excessive grid lines.

6. Avoid distortion - Use appropriate scaling and avoid distortions to ensure that the graphics accurately represent the data.

7. Provide context - Add context to assist the viewer in comprehending the significance of the data and its relevance to the topic.


```{r flights_data_example, echo=FALSE, out.width='.49\\linewidth', fig.width=3, fig.height=3, fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
# Stacked Density plot
ggplot(data=flights %>% filter(dest %in% c("ATL", "ORD","MDW") ), aes(x=distance, fill=carrier)) +
geom_density(position="stack")

# Histogram
ggplot(data=flights %>% filter(dest %in% c("ATL", "ORD","MDW") ), aes(x=distance, fill=carrier)) +
geom_histogram(position="stack")

```


On the other hand, Dashboards are interactive interfaces that display data visually to provide insights and support decision-making. 
Dashboards can be used to monitor key performance indicators, track progress over time, and identify patterns and trends in data. 
They often display real-time data and can be customized to show the most relevant data to the user.


#### Interactive Graphics

Interactive graphics are excellent for EDA; they are designed for exploring rather than presenting information (and more) and can be obtained by directly querying the graphic, @unwin2003.

The area of interactive graphics is still very much a work in progress despite existing as a field of research since the late 1960sâ€”developments are driven partly by new technology, such as `d3` [@bostock2011]. 
Visualizations are more than just a picture. 
They are now a tool that facilitates analytic activity through different modes of interaction [@yi2007]. 
Visualization is context-free, as it can mean different things to different people depending on the situation [@parsons2014]. 

Interactive graphics, are essential to EDA [@unwin1999]. 
Beyond the limitations of static statistical displays, interactive graphics enable visualizations to advance alongside the analysis. 
User interaction and direct manipulation are required for dynamic graphics to reach their full potential (@cook1995; @unwin1999).
The connection between EDA and dashboards is that EDA is the process of preparing and understanding the data, which is the first step for building a dashboard, as the data has to be cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to be used efficiently on the dashboard. 
EDA results can be used to identify the most relevant data and metrics to include in the dashboard and to design the visualizations that will be used to display the data. 
And also, the EDA process can be used to identify the outliers, patterns, trends, and insights that will be useful to show in the dashboard to support decision-making.

The van Wijk Simple Visualization Model is a diagrammatic representation that provides a simple and effective way to understand and visualize the flow of information and data through a system. 
It is a commonly used tool in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is the initial step in the data analysis process. 
The van Wijk model can be used to represent the flow of data from data sources, through intermediate processing stages, to the final visualization of results. 
van Wiij's simple visualization model shows how insights are generated as the human participates in a feedback loop between reading and interacting with visualization, @van2005.

This model is also context-free, allowing for the focus to be on the feedback loops between visualization and the user.

<!-- \svp{This is new to me, but seems like it would be a good way to bridge between the graphics and UI/UX sections I proposed above. } -->
The relationship between the van Wijk Simple Visualization Model and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lies in the area of data visualization. 
The van Wijk Model provides a framework for understanding how information and data flow through a system to be displayed to the user. 
In the context of HCI, the model helps to understand how data is processed, transformed and presented to the user in a way that is intuitive, informative and engaging. 
The model helps to identify the various steps involved in the visualization process, from the collection and processing of data to the presentation of results. 
By doing so, it supports the design of more effective and user-friendly visualizations, which can enhance the overall user experience.

Interaction allows the user to define what data they see and how they see it, creating a dialogue between the user and the system. 
Theories behind visual representation include:

- graphical comprehension (@cleveland1984)
- preattentive processing (@ware2012)
- gestalt theory (@few2009)
- graphical excellence (@tufte2001)

Theories behind the manipulation of visualizations include but are not limited to:

- cognitive fit (@vessey1991)
- visual perceptual approaches (@baker2009)
- human information processing

As interactive visualizations play a more significant role in information systems, designers must know what tasks, visual representations, and interaction techniques are available and how they work to facilitate analytical reasoning. 
They must decide on the most effective visual representation without being able to estimate every user's ability to read and interpret the visualization. <!-- [@boy2014].-->

<!--\db{The human brain can only take in a set amount of data from a table or a paragraph.} \svp{references?}-->

Heer and Bostock examined how the complexity of interactive visualizations influences the cognitive load of users (@heer2010). 
The authors discovered that more intricate visualizations tend to increase cognitive load, especially for users with lower visual literacy. 
They recommended that designers consider the cognitive load of interactive visualizations and strive to reduce complexity whenever possible.

Eissele et al investigated the cognitive load of mobile interactive visualizations (@eissele2009).
The authors discovered that the limited input options and small screen size of mobile devices can increase cognitive load in interactive visualizations. 
To reduce cognitive load on mobile devices, they suggested that designers employ suitable visual encoding techniques and simplify interactions.

Toyama et al. investigated the impact of interactive elements on cognitive load in visualizations. (@toyama2015)
Based on the nature of the task and the user's familiarity with the interactive features, the authors discovered that interactive features can both increase and decrease cognitive load. 
They suggested that designers should evaluate the cognitive load caused by the interactive elements they include in visualizations.

These studies suggest that designers should carefully consider the cognitive load implications of interactive graphics and strive, whenever possible, to reduce complexity. 
Simplifying interactions and implementing suitable visual encoding techniques can reduce cognitive load, especially on mobile devices. 
In addition, designers should evaluate the cognitive load caused by the interactive features they include in visualizations.

## Audience-Data Interactions

User analysis is a crucial step in the design of user interfaces, especially in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) design. 
It involves studying the users of a system to understand their needs, goals, and behaviors. 
The purpose of user analysis is to create interfaces that are easy to use, efficient, and effective for the intended audience.
The results of user analysis can be used to inform the design of the interface, including the layout, navigation, and functionality. 
It can also be used to identify areas of the interface that are confusing or difficult to use and to make recommendations for improvements. 
User analysis is an iterative process, and it should be done in multiple stages of the design process to ensure that the final product is tailored to the users' needs.


### Testing static graphics

<!-- Brief overview of user studies that compare different types of graphics, accuracy, etc. -->

Cleveland and McGill investigated the effect of various bar chart designs on the accuracy with which viewers perform simple perceptual tasks @cleveland1986. 
People perform significantly worse on stacked bar charts than on simple bar charts, and bar charts with filled bars are generally superior to those with empty ones.

Jiao et al. examine the use of unit charts to represent large-scale data @jiao. 
The study discovered that unit charts are more precise and easier to read than traditional bar graphs for representing values across multiple orders of magnitude.

"The cognitive style of PowerPoint: Pitching out corrupts within" examined the effect of static graphics, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, on the comprehension and decision-making of viewers @tufte2008. 
The results indicated that the bar chart was most effective at accurately communicating information, while the pie chart was least effective. 
In addition, the researchers discovered that the type of graphic employed influenced the viewers' perceptions and decision-making, highlighting the significance of selecting the most appropriate graphics when conveying information.

"Using color to code different types of uncertainty in visualization" investigated the effect of color on the communication effectiveness of static graphics @ware2010. 
Researchers discovered that the use of color in static graphics enhanced viewers' comprehension and memory retention of the presented information. 
Specifically, it was determined that the use of color to highlight particular data points or trends in a graph or chart was particularly effective.

"Communicating Uncertainty: A Look at Graphical Representations of Error Bars, Box Plots, and Confidence Intervals" examined the efficacy of static graphics in communicating data uncertainty and variability @wainer2020. 
Researchers discovered that static graphics, such as boxplots and error bars, effectively communicated the range and variability of data. 
Furthermore, the use of static graphics enhanced viewers' comprehension and decision-making in uncertain situations.

Overall, these above studies indicate that static graphics are effective at conveying information to viewers, with their effectiveness being influenced by the type of graphic exercised, the use of color, and their capacity to convey uncertainty and variability in data. 
However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of static graphics can also be affected by audience knowledge and experience, the complexity of the information being presented, and the context in which the graphics are used.

### Testing interactive graphics

The design space of interactive visualizations, including the use of multiple views and coordinated multiple views, is discussed in a paper by Heer and Bostock @heer2012. 
The authors argue that interactive visualizations can enhance comprehension and decision-making by enabling users to investigate complex data and the relationships between multiple variables.
It was discovered that interactive graphics are particularly useful for investigating data that is difficult to comprehend with static graphics, such as time series data or data with multiple aggregation levels.

Compared to static graphics, interactive graphics can improve users' ability to identify patterns and outliers in data, according to a second study @wu2017. 
This is due to the fact that interactive graphics enable users to zero in on particular aspects of the data and adjust the visualization in real time to reveal hidden patterns.

It has also been discovered that interactive graphics increase user engagement with data and improve their decision-making abilities. 
"Visualizing decision-making: Introducing the analysis, comparison, and exploration system (ACES)" showed that interactive graphics can help users make more informed decisions by allowing them to compare and contrast various scenarios and outcomes @kornhauser2014. 
Moreover, interactive graphics can help users identify potential biases or errors in their data analysis by allowing them to rapidly explore various visualizations and test their hypotheses.

In addition to their benefits for data exploration and analysis, interactive graphics have been found to be more engaging and enjoyable for users @eppler2013. 
This can increase the motivation of users to explore and analyze data, resulting in better decision-making.

In summary, the studies highlighted indicate that interactive graphics can be an effective data visualization and analysis tool, especially for complex and multidimensional data. 
They can improve users' comprehension, engagement, and decision-making skills, and are ideal for examining data that is difficult to comprehend with static graphics.

## Dashboard Design

Given that the audience has limitations, there are design constraints around the data, and the ability of the audience to successfully use the graphical displays of the data, what can we take from this body of research that applies to more complicated sets of graphics? 

How do we maintain user attention, desire to explore, and accurately communicate the data through the medium of an interactive data dashboard?

A dashboard is a visual display of the essential information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance [@few2006]. 
Dashboards have particular characteristics:

- Achieve specific objectives
- Fits on a single computer screen
- Information can be displayed in multiple mediums (web browser or mobile device)
- Can be used to monitor information at a high level

Dashboards can present various statistical data, such as financial performance, website traffic, or customer engagement metrics. 
They allow users to quickly and easily understand complex data sets using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables to display the information. 
Additionally, statistics can be used to analyze data presented on a dashboard, providing insights into trends and patterns that can inform decision-making.

While a dashboard can be handy, it may be worth describing that a poorly designed dashboard will not be used. 
A dashboard should be concise, clear, and intuitive when displaying components in combination with a customized list of requirements of users.

Much of the work done within statistical research and dashboard design involves collaboration with other researchers and users. 
While this may be the best for the growth of the discipline, one will find that working with collaborators with non-STEM backgrounds.
Dashboards can help understand and support many data types in essential business objectives. 
There are many different ways to label and utilize dashboards in different kinds.

Dashboards are cognitive tools that should be used to improve understanding of data, which should help people visually find relationships, trends, patterns, and outliers. 
Most importantly, dashboards should leverage people's visual cognitive capabilities.

Cowan suggested that the average person can only hold two to six pieces of information in their attention @cowan2001. 
People can develop detailed understandings of reality, which is infinitely complex.

Cognitive structures consist of mental models and their relationships (@rumelhart1976; @carley1992; @jonassen1996).
A schema is a mental model containing a breadth of information about a specific object or concept. 
Schemas are organized into semantic networks based on their relationships to other schemas (@wertheimer1938; @rumelhart1976).
This arrangement helps the brain process its experiences instead of storing every sensory observation; the brain only needs to maintain its schemas, which are good summaries of all previous observations. 
Some "memories" may even be complete recreations built with a schema (@bartlett1932; @klein2007)

Wixon introduce "contextual design" as a systems development method in which the researcher partners with the user at the user's place of work to "develop a shared understanding" of the user's activities, and they define contextual inquiry as the first part of the broader process [@cowan2001]. 
Contextual inquiry is the data collection step of the field research element of the contextual design method, and it emphasizes four essential principles:

1. The context of the activity being performed by the user 
2. The partnership between the researcher and the participant
3. The spoken verification that the investigator's interpretation of the activity matches the user's
4. The focus of the study is central to the approach taken by the interviewer

Kandal conducted what might be considered a contextual interview study similar to ours in that they analyzed data scientists' self-reported work processes [@kandel2012]. 
They proposes three main archetypes that data scientists may be classed into the following:

- Hackers: who build processes chaining together multiple programming languages of different types (analytical, scripting, and database languages) and use visualization in various environments.
- Scripters: who perform most of their analysis in an analytical environment (e.g., R or Python) and execute the most complex statistical modeling of the types but who do not perform statements their ETL
- Application Users: who performed most or all of their work in an application such as Excel or SPSS and, like scripters, relied on others (namely, their organizations' IT departments) for ETL.

<!-- This is where your paragraph about 2 good graphics being suboptimal together should go -->

Combining two effective graphics does not necessarily result in a successful visualization. 
In certain instances, suboptimal combinations can result in confusion, misinterpretation, and the failure to convey the intended message.
Combining two charts with distinct scales or units is an example of suboptimal graphic design, which can result in misinterpretation and flawed comparisons. 
For example, if a bar chart displaying the number of sales is combined with a line chart displaying revenue, meaningful comparisons between the two metrics can be challenging. 
People frequently make inaccurate judgments when comparing graphs with different scales, according to a study conducted by Cleveland and McGill (@cleveland1984).

Utilizing redundant visual cues or unnecessary embellishments is another example of suboptimal graphics. 
Although it may be tempting to add extra elements to a chart or graph, doing so can detract from the primary message and make it more difficult for the audience to focus on the essential information. 
Tufte discovered that adding unnecessary visual cues to a graph decreases its effectiveness because viewers are more likely to focus on the embellishments rather than the data (@tufte1985).

Using multiple color schemes or palettes in the same chart is another instance of suboptimal graphics. 
While color can be an effective visual communication tool, the use of excessive colors or color schemes can be overwhelming and confusing. 
This can detract from the primary message and make it challenging for the audience to comprehend the key points. 
In a study conducted by Heer and Bostock, participants were required to interpret multiple color schemes (@heer2010). 
Multiple color schemes made it difficult for participants to identify the relationships between different parts of the visualization, according to the study.

Conversely, it can be suboptimal to combine two visually incompatible graphics. 
For instance, if a scatter plot and a bar chart are combined, the resulting visualization may be difficult to interpret due to the incompatibility of the two types of graphics. 
This issue was highlighted by Hullman et al., who discovered that viewers had difficulty interpreting a visualization that incorporated a scatter plot and a line chart (@hullman2011).
