Dashboard Design with naive users at the center of the design with adding new graphical visualization and testing the effectiveness of new graphics.

Data Visualizations are described as a graphical representation of tabular data and information. Data visualization tools are used in ways to accessible way to see and understand trends, outlines, and patterns in data.

<!--  Give a "big picture" of the literature-->
The literature review will explore the facets of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through the history of graphical representation, followed by the study of Dashboard Design, Visual Information, and Big Data Analytics.

Roles of graphics in Data Analysis:
Graphics and Tables are forms of communication that we are looking to determine:

*What is the audience?*
Our audience is those users who “know” their data but cannot utilize it due to a lack of skills and resources.

*What is the message?*
The message will be to understand how to communicate visual information of statistical graphics in an ethical and understandable way.

We can break down statistical graphics into two categories:
- Analysis: design to see patterns, trends, and the process of data description, interpretation
- Presentation: design to attract attention, make a point, illustrate a conclusion


Based on the following diagram

<!-- Present a thesis or argument statement - why is it important to explore this topic?-->
As tabular data grows in our society, it has pushed our need to create visualizations that represent that data in a correct and digestible way. The work that has been done in statistical graphics research would suggest that the work that is done in this work has grown increasingly in formal adding sound guidelines with statistically sound metrics that are needed. This work has been explored in various disciplines but not in statistical graphics. We know that dashboards are visual information tools that include and have multiple statistical pictures. Thus, we should consider and think about the fact that we may need to consider the statistical and psychological framework in a dashboard that will combine multiple statistical graphics.


One graphic can be misleading alone, but can two graphics be considered misleading when placing two "correctly" designed graphics together on a dashboard? This is something that visual information researchers explore but don't test. We would like to test the combination with interactive features, such as map selection and highlighted lines in Parallel Coordinate Plot, for example.


Since we don't completely understand the way that basic statistical graphics are

When effectively adding advanced graphical representations to a naive user, what have we done to create a proper understanding of an engaging idea of what's going on?

<!--Theme: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the History of Graphical Representations -->
## History of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<!-- Overview of characteristics of the theme -->
Visualizations of data are essential for exploratory data analysis (EDA) along with model diagnostics. Plots for EDA are a valuable tool for guiding an analyst in discovering the relationships between variables in their data. When using plots in model diagnostics, plots help analysts determine whether or not the model is an appropriate way to model. During the initial EDA stage, an analyst may find that a variable or a covariate is directly related to the dependent variable when looking at a correlation heatmap or a scatterplot. This will be important to know before starting a linear model analysis. Much of our general understanding is from introductory statistics courses. The basic understanding can be formalized to visualize the discovery process.

### Study 1: EDA through the eyes of Tukey

John Tukey was the first to organize the collection and methods associated with philosophy into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Tukey was a person who helped utilize the likes of stem-and-leaf plot, boxplot-resistant smooth, and rootgram.

Tukey's Principles in EDA:

1. Graphical exploration looking for patterns or displaying fit.
- The method demonstrates things about data that are not understood by a single numeric metric. This has been useful in graphing the data before you develop summary statistics.

2. Describing the general patterns of the data.
- This step should be insensitive to outliers. In general, think about the types of resistant measures (i.e., median or mean). This step is making sure to determine data patterns.

3. The natural scale/state that the data are at their best. This will be the step at which the scale of data can be helpful for analysis. The reexpressing data to a new scale by taking the square root or logarithmic scale.

4. The mostly known parts of EDA but is done in the way of accessing fit of the data. This is taught in every statistics 101 class. The growth of machine learning and prediction methods have now used residuals more in the toolbox to access the best prediction models.
- The idea generally is to determine the deviations in the data from a general pattern by looking at the data from the fit of the data.


### EDA through the eyes of the modern grammar of graphics
The grammar of graphics (gg of ggplot2) is a theory that is well-defined for creating statistical graphics with work from Wilkinson [@Wilkinson1999] and Hadley Wickham [@ggplot2]. Leland Wilkinson created the structure and defined the phrase. Grammar of graphics is defined as the framework which follows a layered approach to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/ggDiagram}
\captionof{figure}{Grammar of Graphics Diagram of Wickham and Wilkinson's work}
\end{center}

The theory of graphics is based on plot layers, which are built with four distinct pieces:

- data - *tabular formatted from user*
- aesthetic mapping - *takes data and maps the variable in the data frame to a particular visual features*
- statistical transformation - *determines how to transform the data to values to create the visual feature*
- geometric object and a position adjustment - *geom object is used to draw a plot layer, and position adjustment is to help with adjusting the visual feature in the space*

Seven major components help build effective visualizations that build on one another. Seven major components help build effective visualizations. The following diagram will display the effectiveness of data graphics:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/EffectiveDataGraphics}
\captionof{figure}{Effective Data Graphics}
\end{center}


### EDA through the eyes of Big Data and Big Data Analytics

Big Data Analytics is where advanced analytic techniques are applied to big data sets.
- Analytics based on extensive data samples reveals and leverages business change.
The larger the data set, the more difficult it becomes to manage. This paradigm has only become more and more of the pieces of data exploration since tabular data is growing.


#### Characteristics of Big Data
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/BigDataDiagram}
\captionof{figure}{Big Data Diagram}
\end{center}

The Big Data Diagram will display the three main features and characteristics of big data:
- Volume: is its size and how enormous it is
- Variety: includes the different formats and types of data, as well as the different kinds of uses and ways of analyzing the data
- Velocity: refers to the rate with which data is changing or how often it is created


#### Big Data Storage and Management

We can't discuss big data analytics without discussing data storage and management. Our tasks with big data storage is to determine where and how this data will be stored once it is acquired:
- Traditional structured data storage and retrieval methods include relational databases, data marts, and data warehouses.
- Uploaded to the storage from operational data stores using: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) tools which extract data from outside sources, transform the data to fit operational needs, and transform and cataloged before made available for data mining and online analytical functions.

Given the growing numbers of data sources and the sophistication of data analyses, big data storage should allow analysts to produce and adapt data rapidly.

- This requires an agile database whose current data analyses use complex statistical methods, and analysts need to be able to be deep and serve as a sophisticated algorithmic run time engine.


## History/Review of Graphical Representation

### History/Origin of Statistical Visualization

Visualization is NOT prediction. Much of the field is focus on prediction models but big data analytics visualization is an important part of working to develop methodology for helping analysts to explore and understand what patterns are presented. 

> The data from plots can be very different from what would be learned by modeling and prediction which means both types of summarization are equally important.


Visual inference uses our ability to detect graphical anomalies. The idea of formal testing remains the same in visual inference – with one exception: The test statistic is now a graphical display which is compared to a “reference distribution” of plots showing the null.

### Statistical Visualization Timeline
*Categorical Data Visualization*
Friendly[@friendly2014] detailed using SAS with hand-on experiment to visually present categorical data analysis. PCPs have been used by researchers, to visualize categorical data. Beygelzimer, Perng, Ma [@beygelzimer2001]; Ma and Hellerstien [@ma2001] created a fast ordering categorical data analysis algorithm helped visualization, where their algorithms help organize the original parallel coordinate plots clearer. Hammock plots are modified versions of parallel coordinate plots, which was invented by Schonlau to visualize categorical data [@schonlau2003]. His design replace coordinate polygons by rectangles to present the number. Treemaps are modified to support categorical data visualization.

CatTree gives a hierarchical categorical data visualization with interaction [@kolatch2001]. Fernstad developed an interactive system combining parallel coordinate, tables and scatterplot matrix together for an overview explorative analysis. Fully research on categorical data visualization to support algorithm understanding. Novel contingency wheel presented by [@alsallakh2011] support visual analytics in categorical data and he measured association based on Pearson's residuals and use visual abstraction based on elements frequency.  

*High-Dimensional Data Visualization*
A popular research area in visualization research since high-dimensional data is always fuzzy to mining. Direct visualization includes geometric visualizations:

- scatterplots: simply use dot in coordinate to present data point.
- parallel coordinates: present each dimension as axes and every data item intersects dimensions as polygon line at certain position
- RadViz/ PolyViz
- GridViz

Besides these traditional geometric visualization methods, iconographic displays like human faces and star glyps used funny ways to present multivariate data. Hierarchical methods used widely in parallel coordinates, which give analysts an intuitive view of clustering information [@fua1999]; [@johansson2005]. Rearrange the dimensions by dimensions similarity on parallel coordinates, circle segments and recursive patterns. [@ankerst1998]. [@guo2003] used interactive feature selection method help users identify interesting subspaces from high-dimensional data sets.

*Visualizing Complex Data*

William Cleveland's subcycle plots:
- glyphmaps and binned graphics that are emerging from big data visualization efforts.

- glyphs and other plots have been embedded in maps 

Bertin's semiologic of Graphics, a seminal work  in the academic study of visualization. Glyphmaps have been developed as a tool for tracking climate and climate change data [@wickham2012]; [@hobbs2010]

*Interactive Graphics*

The area of interactive graphics is still very much a work in progress despite existing as field of research since the late 1960s. Developments driven in part by new technology, such as `d3` [@bostock2011].

Visualizations are more than just a picture. They are now a tool that facilities analytic activity through different modes of interaction. [@yi2007]. The term visualization is context-free, as it can mean different things to different people depending on the situation [@parsons2014]. van Wiij's [@van2005] simple visualization model shows how insights are generated as the human participates in a feedback  loop between reading and interacting with visualization. This model is also context-free allow for the focus to be on the feedback loops between visualization and user.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/vanWiijSimpleModel}
\captionof{figure}{van Wiij Simple Visualization Model}
\end{center}

Interaction allows the user to define what data they see and how they see the data creating a dialogue between the user and the system. Theories behind visual representation include:
- graphical comprehension ([@cleveland1984])
- preattentive processing ([@ware2012])
- gestalt theory ([@few2009])
- graphical excellence ([@tufte2001])

Theories behind the manipulation of visualizations include but are not limited to 
- cognitive fit ([@vessey1991])
- visual perceptual approaches ([@baker2009])
- human information processing

As interactive visualizations take a larger role in information systems, designers must know what tasks, visual representations, and interaction techniques are available and how they work in concert to facilitate analytical reasoning. They must decided on the most effective visual representation without being able to estimate every user's ability to read and interpret the visualization [@boy2014]. Tasks can be viewed either by the goal the user is trying to obtain or by the intent the user has 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/tentypetasks}
\captionof{figure}{10 Type Tasks with Sources}
\end{center}

Interaction of Type Tasks facilitate data exploration leading to the generation of new insights. Interactions explicitly place humans in the loop where visualizations leverage the human perceptual system reducing the cognitive load required for data analysis ([@endert2015], [@sedig2012]). More systems are using interactive visualizations, as opposed to static visualizations, which in turn requires a strong need to fully understanding the effectiveness of interaction techniques [@saket2018].

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/interactiontasks}
\captionof{figure}{Interaction Types with Sources}
\end{center}

[@schulz2013] define two abstractions for the design of visualizations:
\begin{center}
\begin{align*}
  Data + Task = Visualization \\
  Data + Visualization = Task
\end{align*}
\end{center}
These abstractions demonstrate dependence between the data, visual representation, and the task. The more the user interacts with the visualization, they gain knowledge. The interactions allow user to be in control of their understanding by providing the flexibility to create new views that help him/her go beyond just the visual representation [@kiem2008]. The field of information visualization is continually adapting to changes with the big data revolution.

### Advancement of graphical visualizations in dashboards

Visualizations have become more effective in recent years due to the pandemic and the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard [@JHPHDashboard] [Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). We were glued to our computers, TVs, and phones for most of the world. As a result, we watched the dashboard change in real-time to adapt to the users' needs. In part to data growth and changing, the dashboard, as well as the visualizations, were needed in a condensed platform. The need to be concise and vastly informative can be a bit of a struggle when it comes to data visualizations. The human brain can only take in a set amount of data at a time from a table or a paragraph. The space of infographics has been a much better way of looking at data on a creative scale. While this may be a way of seeing the data in a friendly way, infographics need to include an interactive piece of data that many people would like to explore.

### Applications

Two general applications in areas of visual inference have developed since the work of [@buja2009]. These applications are actual methodology and methodology based on protocols.  Actual methodology applications are used with alternative and corresponding null hypotheses, which perform visual inference tests to show many participants of different backgrounds with lineups.


## Dashboard Design/ Human Perception (Visual Information)

### History/Origin of Dashboard Design

A dashboard is a visual display of the most essential information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance[@few]. A dashboard has particular characteristics:

- Achieve specific objectives
- Fits on a single computer screen
- Information can be displayed in multiple mediums (web browser or mobile device)
- Can be used to monitor information at a high level

While a dashboard can be extremely useful, it may be worth describing that a poorly designed dashboard will not be used. A dashboard should be concise, clear, and intuitive when displaying components in combination with a customized list of requirements of users.

Much of the work done within statistical research and dashboard design involves collaboration with other academic researchers. While this may be the best for the growth of the discipline, one will find that working with collaborators with non-STEM backgrounds. 

A collaboration is when 2 or more entities work together to produce a desired and shared outcome. Interdisciplinary research with collaboration is a pinnacle aspect of dashboards and statistical graphics to produce innovation and scientific knowledge.

The National Academies defines research collaboration as follows [@NATIONALACADEMYOFSCIENCES]:

> Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) is a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or field of research practice.


### Section 8: History/Origin of Human Perception of Statistical Graphics
Human perception plays a direct role in the area of visualization. The importance of human perception importance was cited by the NSF panel on graphics and image processing that proposed "scientific visualization" [@NSF].

Data Analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as sensemaking. Tukey and Wilk [@tukey1966] highlight the role of cognitive processes in their initial descriptions of EDA.

> The primary general intent of data analysis is simply to seek through a body of data for exciting relationships and information and to exhibit the results in such a way as to make them recognizable to the data analyzer.

Mallows and Walley [@mallows1980] list psychology as one of four areas likely to support a theory of analysis. Data analyses rely on the mind's ability to learn, analyze, and understand. Assigning meaning is not a statistical or computational step but a cognitive one. Each data analysis is part of a more extensive cognitive process.

Untrained analysts can and do "analyze" data with only their natural mental abilities
- The mind performs its data analysis-like process to create detailed understandings of reality from bits of sensory input.

#### Schemas and Sensemaking
Cowan [@cowan2001] suggested that the average person can only hold two to six pieces of information in their attention. People can develop detailed understandings of reality, which is infinitely complex.

Cognitive structures consists of mental models and their relationships ([@rumelhart1976], [@carley1992], [@jonassen1996]). Mental models have been studied under several different names, which are displayed in the following image of Cognitive Structures:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/CognitiveStructuresCitationTimeline}
\captionof{figure}{Cognitive Structures Citation Timeline}
\end{center}

A schema is a mental model containing a breadth of information about a specific object or concept. Schemas are organized into semantic networks based on their relationships to other schemas [@wertheimer1938], [@rumelhart1976]. This arrangement helps the brain process its experiences instead of storing every sensory observation, the brain only needs to maintain its schemas, which are sufficient summaries of all previous observations. Some "memories" may even be complete recreations built with a schema [@bartlett1932], [@klein2007]

### Section 9: Dashboard Design in regards to Human Perception

Data Scientists and Statisticians have produced more graphics since the pandemic's start. The reasons someone will create a graphic or dashboard may include but are not limited to understanding raw data structures to analyze model assumptions and present predictions along with displaying key performance metrics of business logic. These goals help work to navigate and are best served by quick-and-dirty representations of the data, while highly polished graphics may be more useful in other situations. It is valuable and essential to convey data correctly, meaning that we need to understand how graphics are perceived on a dashboard on a general level. Previous research by Tukey focused on graphics as a tool for exploratory analysis. Tukey describes in Exploratory Data Analysis [@tukey1966] that pictures are often used to display data in a more enhanced version than a table. Tukey outlines detailed the types of different graphics and in which situations to utilize these graphics. The article - "External cognition: how do graphical representations work?" by Scaife and Rogers [@scaife1996] critique the disparate literature on graphical representations, focusing on four representative studies. In general, this will help in the psychology of the perceptual experience.


The visual reference model developed by Card et al. [@Card] describes and identifies the three phases of the visualization process.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/VizModelDiagram}
\captionof{figure}{Visual Reference model by Card}
\end{center}


While External Cognition describes the advances in graphical technology and how little had been done in the work of the cognitive framework of the discipline, the following citations by Ware attempt to develop the necessary guidelines that are useful for the work done by the perceptual experience.

Colin Ware "Information Visualization: Perception for Design" [@Ware2004] there are four stages of visualization
- The collection and storage of data itself
- The preprocessing design to transform the data into something we can understand
- The display hardware and the graphics algorithms produce the image on the screen.
- The human perceptual and cognitive system


The overlapping understanding in the field, while Ware takes the process one step further not just to allow the end user to understand the outcomes but to curate the outcomes with a visual perception of the data that makes the cognitive load easier for the end-user.

A dashboard has much information related to tabular data from multiple sources. Design should be recorded a produced with content that will allow for reproducibility. A dashboard should have some content related to interaction with the user. This interaction can be in multiple forms: toggling through the selection of variables to display uniformly to the use of interaction on the graph. Allowing a user to best understand what is being displayed in the graph.

The entire dashboard/Interface should have a human perception piece that is useful for the user to comprehend and use. If the user is visually overwhelmed, then the dashboard/interface is not practical.

- Identified the highly relevant from a dashboard design perspective [@odonnell2000]
1. Interaction and feedback are given by information systems
2. Type of presentation format to be used
3. Differences in the amount of information load.

Information load is essential, as dashboards must provide the right decision cues without overwhelming the user with excess information.

"A decision cue is a feature of something perceived that is used in the interpretation of perception [@choo2009]," where perception is an inferential process as objects in the environment can only be perceived indirectly through available information that has been sensed by the individual [@brunswik1952].

Visual complexity and information utility are required. Visual complexity refers to the "degree of difficulty in providing a verbal description of an image.[@heaps1999], [@olivia2004]

- Graphs are more suitable for spatial tasks (ex., for comparing a set of values) [@vessey1991],[@umanath1994]; [@vessey1994]
- Graphs reduced the negative influence of information overload
- Graphs produced better correlation estimates and decreased time on a task [@schulzand ; @booth2006]
- Self-organizing maps and multidimensional scaling did not significantly outperform tabular representations [@huang2006]

The purposes of a dashboard:

1. Consistency
2. Monitoring
3. Planning
4. Communication

"Use interactive visual representations of abstract, non-physically based data to amplify cognition." [@card1999]

Visual perception involves two elements - the perceptual and conceptual gist. The perceptual gist refers to the process of the brain when it determines the image properties that provide the structural representation of a scene, like color and texture. The conceptual gist refers to the scene's meaning, which is improved after the perceptual information is received. [@friedman1979]; [@olivia2004]

Visual complexity might increase with the quality and range of objects and with varying material and surface styles [@heylighen1997].

Repetitive and uniform patterns and existing knowledge of the objects in the scene reduce visual complexity [@olivia2004]

Guidelines for new generation dashboards refer to:
1. Aligning business processes with the latest information to provide business intelligence at all levels in the company.
2. Using intuitive and easy-to-digest visuals for delivering information to busy executives.
3. Sound Navigation
[@ZiffDavisEnterprise2008]

If the guidelines on our visual information load can be related to statistical terminology, we can consider this the fisher information of visual information load. This load can be used as a metric for balancing the amount of information rather than overloading the consumer.

Visual Data Mining

For data mining to be effective, it is important to include humans in the data exploration process and combine the flexibility, creativity, and general knowledge of the computational power of today's computers. Visual data exploration aims at integrating humans in the data exploration process, applying their perceptual abilities to the large data sets available in today's computer systems.[@kiem2002]

The visual data exploration process can be seen as a hypothesis generation process:
- The visualizations of the data allow the user to gain insight into the data and come up with new hypotheses
- Along with verification of the hypotheses

The main advantages of visual data exploration over automatic data mining techniques from statistics or machine learning are:
- visual data exploration can efficiently deal with highly inhomogeneous and noisy data.
- visual data exploration is intuitive and requires no understanding of complex mathematical or statistical algorithms or parameters.

Visual Exploration Paradigm, also known as MGV (Massive Graph Visualizer), is an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multidigraph navigation.[@abello2002]. MGV usually follows a three-step process:
- overview first
- zoom and filter
- details-on-demand

The user identifies interesting patterns and focuses on one or more of them. Note that visualization technology does not only provide the base visualization techniques for all three steps but also bridges the gap between the steps.

Visualization Technique Classification:
- Standard 2D/3D displays such as bar charts and x-y plots
- Geometrically transformed displays, such as landscapes and parallel coordinates, as used in a scalable framework
- Icon-based displays such as needle icons and star icons as used in MGV
- Dense pixel displays such as the recursive pattern and circle segments techniques and the graph sketches as used in MGV
- Stacked displays, such as treemaps or dimensional stacking

Interaction and distortion techniques allow users to interact directly with the visualizations.
- Projection as used in the Grand Tour System
- Filtering as used in Polaris
- Zooming as used in MGV and scalable framework
- Linking and Brushing as used in Polaris and the scalable framework

Design Theory in Information System

The knowledge is distinguished as the fifth of five types of theory:
1. Analyzing & describing
2. Understanding
3. Predicting
4. Explaining and predicting 
5. Design and action

A definition of information systems that are suitable for our purposes concerns: "the effective design delivery use and impact of information technology in organizations and society [@avison1995]. 

The two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information systems discipline:
 - *Behavioral Science Paradigm* - seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior (roots in natural science research methods).
 - *Data Science Paradigm* - seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts (roots in engineering and the sciences of the artificial).[@simon1996]
 
 Technology and behavior are not dichotomous in an information system. They are inseparable [@lee2000]. Information technology (IT) artifacts are broadly defined as:
 - constructs (vocabulary & symbols)
 - models (abstractions & representations)
 - methods (algorithms & practices)
 - instantiations  (implemented & prototype systems)
 
These are concrete prescriptions that enable IT researchers and practitioners to understand and address the problems inherent in developing and successfully implementing information systems within organizations ([@march1995]; [@nunamaker1991]). 
 
 
 ### Interactive Visualization in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figure/EDAWorkflowElements}
\captionof{figure}{Elements of EDA Workflow}
\end{center}
 
Data Scientists and other analytic professionals often use interactive visualization in the dissemination phase at the end of a workflow, during which findings are communicated to a wider audience. Digital tools are critical to data science and analytics workflows, and current practice spans the following:
- *Data Analysis Tools* - R, Pandas and SAS
- *Data Warehousing Services* - MySQL, MongoDB, or Amazon Redshift
- *Machine Learning Libraries* - scikit-learn o Apache MLlib

A common process typically consists of the following general stages:
1. *Discovery*: Formulating an exciting question and determining the data necessary to answer it.
2. *Acquisition*: Locating, organizing, and preparing data to be accessible to the chosen analysis environment.
3. *Exploration*: Investigating and analyzing the data set to collect insights and understand the data
4. *Modeling*: Building fitting and validating a model that can explain the data set and the observed phenomena
5. *Communication*: Disseminating the results to stakeholders in reports, presentations, and charts.

Static Visualization is commonly used in the communication phase of data science workflows, and data scientists sometimes use them as part of the analysis. John Tukey's EDA methods are known and well-vetted in the field currently. However, [@satyanarayan2016] began to address this by introducing a high-level grammar of graphics called "Vega-Lite", which presents a set of standardized linguistic rules for producing interactive information visualizations using a concise JSON format for data to be represented by the grammar. Vega-Lite has been directly implemented in R via the `ggvis` package using the same - albeit slightly lower-level.


Contextual Design

[@wixon1990] introduce "contextual design" as a systems development method in which the researcher partners with the user at the user's place of work to "develop a shared understanding" of the user's activities, and they define contextual inquiry as the first part of the broader process. Contextual inquiry is the data collection step of the field research element of the contextual design method, and it emphasizes four essential principles:

1. The context of the activity being performed by the user 
2. The partnership between the researcher and the participant
3. The spoken verification that the investigator's interpretation of the activity matches the user's
4. The focus of the study is central to the approach taken by the interviewer

[@kandel2012] conducted what might be considered a contextual interview study similar to ours in that they analyzed data scientists' self-reported work processes. Kandal proposes three main archetypes that data scientists may be classed into the following:

- Hackers: who build processes chaining together multiple programming languages of different types (analytical, scripting, and database languages) and use visualization in various environments.
- Scripters: who perform most of their analysis in an analytical environment (e.g. R or Python) and perform the most complex statistical modeling of the types but who do not perform their ETL
- Application Users: who performed most or all of their work in an application such as Excel or SPSS and, like scripters, relied on others (namely, their organizations' IT departments) for ETL.


Dashboards can help understand and support many data types in essential business objectives. There are many different ways to label and utilize dashboards into different types.

Dashboards are cognitive tools that should be used to improve understanding of data, which should help people visually find relationships, trends, patterns, and outliers. Most importantly, dashboards should leverage people's visual cognitive capabilities.

EDA refers to methods and procedures for exploring the data space to learn about a data set. By analogy, exploratory modeling analysis (EMA) refers to methods and procedures for exploring the space of models which may be fit to a data set.

Interactive graphics are excellent for EDA, they are designed for exploring rather than presenting information (and more) and can be obtained by directly querying the graphic [@unwin2003].

- PCPs enable the display of multi-dimensional data in two-dimensional space.
- There must be some loss of information, but this can be partly counteracted by varying the order of the axes.
- Interactivity is valuable for reordering the axes flexibly and fast.
- Interaction is valuable for dealing with the dense mass of lines produced by large data sets.

Being able to select subgroups of cases, highlight the selected lines, and switch between different subgroups all assist in interpreting the otherwise intricate displays which arise.

## `ggpcp` package - Generalized Parallel Coordinate Plots

## Parallel Coordinate Plot Visualization Review

Parallel coordinate plots have been implemented in analysis software since the mid-1980s ([@Inselberg], [@Wegman]). Parallel Coordinate Plot Visualization, also called parallel plot, is an established field of high dimensional visualization of XY coordinate analysis. Parallel coordinate plots have a unique structure that will allow for data structures with n-dimensions. As data grows in exploratory data analysis, data visualizations will be more critical and valuable to understanding the underlying structures of valid data for analyses. Several packages in R are dedicated to visualizing parallel coordinate plots.

Dashboards can help understand and support many data types in essential business objectives. There are many different ways to label and utilize dashboards into different types.

Dashboards are cognitive tools that should be used to improve understanding of data, which should help people visually find relationships, trends, patterns, and outliers. Most importantly, dashboards should leverage people's visual cognitive capabilities.

- There must be some loss of information, but this can be partly counteracted by varying the order of the axes.
- Interactivity is valuable for reordering the axes flexibly and fast.
- Interaction is valuable for dealing with the dense mass of lines produced by large data sets.

Being able to select subgroups of cases, highlight the selected lines, and switch between different subgroups all assist in interpreting the otherwise intricate displays which arise.


### R Packages

R packages exist for Parallel coordinate plots, with some built-in functionality, but only a few exist for advanced exploratory data analysis visualizations. Beginning with base plot package `parcoord` developed in MASS by [@Venables and Ripley 2004]. The package is limited by extensive, which contains more than methods for the parallel coordinate plot visualization. It contains the following tools for 2D visualization of PCPs. Another package, `gclus` was developed by [@Hurley] and implements `cparcoord` to include panel color of the strength of a correlation between neighboring axes.

While base R packages are helpful, a few packages within the ggplot2 environment implement parallel coordinate plots. With ggplot2 extension packages, the theory of grammar of graphics is at the focal point of plots. The following packages [@ggally] and `ggpcp` are built with the fundamental guidelines for graphic literacy for numeric variables. `GGally` was initially designed for the following pieces of graphic design: [LIST THE PACKAGE'S STARTING PLANS](), so it also contains much more capabilities for PCPs in addition to visualizations. `ggpcp` we separate the data transformations from the visualization, i.e., rather than working with a single function to draw a plot, we are providing a set of functions that work together [@ggpcp].

`ggparallel` implements and combines different types of parallel coordinate plots for categorical data: hammock plots, parallel sets plots, typical angle plots, and typical angle plots with a hammock-like adjustment for line widths [@Heike2013].


### `ggpcp` package importance

As mentioned in previous sections, that parallel coordinate plots have a long line history. However, we are now looking to incorporate the use of categorical data. The `ggpcp` implements the Grammar of graphics and the principled manner of categorical variables. This package separates the data managing part from the plots by giving full user access while keeping the number of parameters manageable. [@ggpcp]

While the `ggpcp` package is the first iteration of the package that can be changed in a way that will allow the user to rearrange the variables on the y-axis, this use can be helpful so that someone will be able to understand better. When we look at graphics through the eyes of someone that is not used to a graphic, we can see the usefulness and effectiveness of allowing more interaction from the user. This consideration is one that will be exhausted in my work. We will explore how one level of interaction from the user can create a better plot for understanding.-->
