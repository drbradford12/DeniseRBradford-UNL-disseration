  In the modern digital era, the exponential growth of data has forced the development and use of user-friendly tools to visualize this data, most notably dashboards. Dashboards are essential for interpreting complex datasets and supporting well-informed decision-making because they are interactive visual representation platforms. This dissertation examines how well these dashboards, in particular those that use open-source data, enable statistical visual inference for users, or "naive users," who have little or no experience with data analytics.
  Due to its democratized nature, open-source data has become a significant source of information, assisting a variety of industries from public health to urban planning. Utilizing this data in dashboards can be extremely beneficial for the general public, especially for those without a thorough understanding of data interpretation. The difficulty, however, lies in creating dashboards that can not only effectively present data but also help uninformed users make accurate statistical inferences without misunderstanding.
