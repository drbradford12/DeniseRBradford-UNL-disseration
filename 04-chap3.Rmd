# Does Color Help?: Multidimensional Ensembles in Bland-Altman Plots: An Exploration {#ref-labels}

## Introduction:

"How can multidimensional ensembles be effectively incorporated into Bland-Altman Plots to enhance the accuracy and comprehensibility of assessing agreement between multiple sets of measurement techniques?"
This research question explores the theoretical and practical implications of incorporating ensemble perception and multidimensional data into Bland-Altman Plots, traditionally used for comparing two measurement methods. 
By doing so, the research seeks to advance the utility and interpretability of these plots in complex, real-world scenarios where multiple dimensions are often at play.

The interpretation of Bland-Altman plots is conventionally one-dimensional, focusing primarily on the mean difference and limits of agreement [@bland1986]. 
However, in real-world applications, the measurements under consideration often contain multiple dimensions that could contribute to the interpretation of the agreement or disagreement between two techniques [@chong2003]. 
Ensemble coding, a perceptual mechanism that provides a statistical summary of a visual scene offers a promising solution to this issue by facilitating the rapid extraction of variability information [@alvarez2011].
The theory of ensemble perception offers a framework for understanding how these multiple dimensions could be processed simultaneously [@haberman2015]; [@whitney2014].

### Ensemble Perception

Ensemble perception is the cognitive ability to quickly derive summary statistics from sets of similar items [@chong2003]. 
This component of visual cognition enables the visual system to summarize and describe collections of comparable objects or features effectively.
This capability is often activated in a brief glance and is crucial for making sense of complex visual scenes. 
David Whitney's fundamental review outlines the core principles of ensemble perception, emphasizing the extraction of summary statistical information from groups of similar objects [@whitney2014], [@dakin1997]. 
[@haberman2015] further discussed that individual differences exist in ensemble perception capabilities, indicating the presence of multiple, independent levels of ensemble representation.

Recent studies have expanded on these principles. 
Khayat et al.'s work explores how ensemble perception can create a unified perception from groups of similar objects and also delves into the implicit perception and memory of set statistics [@khayat2023], [@khayat2021].

The study "Perceptual history biases in serial ensemble representation" by Khayat et al. focuses on the concept of ensemble perception, specifically examining how past visual experiences influence the perception of current visual ensembles. 
The study investigates the serial dependence of ensemble perception when each ensemble set is presented simultaneously but spatially distributed over the screen. 
This suggests that our perception of groups of similar objects is not just influenced by the objects themselves but also by our past experiences with similar ensembles [@khayat2023].
This adds a layer of complexity to the understanding of ensemble perception, which is generally considered as the visual system's ability to efficiently summarize groups of similar objects into a unified perception.

The study "Perceiving ensemble statistics of novel image sets" by Khayat at el. focuses on how the human visual system perceives summary statistics of sets of stimulus elements. 
The study is particularly interested in the perception of novel image sets, suggesting that our ability to understand and interpret new visual information is influenced by our capacity to quickly summarize statistical data from these sets [@khayat2021].
This research contributes to the broader field of ensemble perception, which explores how the visual system can efficiently represent groups of similar objects as a unified perception. 
The study implies that not only can the visual system quickly grasp the "gist" or essence of familiar visual ensembles, but it can also do so for novel sets of images. 
This ability to quickly summarize statistical information from new visual stimuli could be a fundamental feature of human perception [@khayat2018].

Other research has investigated the role of ensemble perception in both high- and low-level visual information, such as emotion and brightness, and how it can even operate when scene information is incomplete [@chakrabarty2020], [@haberman2019].

Furthermore, ensemble perception is not just a specialized function but a pervasive aspect of visual perception. 
It has been discussed in a holistic manner to engage a general audience and has been shown to condense redundant information into summary statistical representations [@corbett2023], [@whitney2022].

Lastly, stable ensemble representations have been found to facilitate visual search, even when they are not predictive of a target location [@utochkin2023].
The study focuses on a coding model that emphasizes the crucial role of the "pooling layer" in ensemble perception. 
Ensemble perception refers to the ability of the visual system to summarize information from a group of similar objects quickly. 
The "pooling layer" in the model likely serves as a computational mechanism for aggregating or summarizing this information, potentially providing insights into how the brain processes complex visual scenes.
In summary, the study aims to provide a more structured understanding of ensemble perception by introducing a model that highlights the importance of a specific computational layer, known as the "pooling layer," in the process of summarizing visual information.


### Multidimensional Ensembles

Initial research on ensemble perception primarily focused on one-dimensional ensembles, where summary statistics are extracted from a single feature or dimension [@haberman2015]. 
However, as [@maule2015] note, real-world scenes often consist of complex, multidimensional attributes, and research has gradually shifted towards understanding how the human visual system processes these more intricate ensembles.

Research on multidimensional ensembles has ventured into understanding how people perceive summary statistics across multiple attributes, such as size and color, simultaneously. 
[@dakin1997] were among the first to explore how orientation statistics are computed from visual textures, extending the concept of ensemble perception into a multidimensional setting. 
[@haberman2015] expanded this research by showing that individual differences exist in ensemble perception capabilities, suggesting that there are multiple, independent levels of ensemble representation.

The existing literature on multidimensional ensembles in visual information covers a range of topics, from neuroscience to data visualization. 
For instance, studies have explored the role of neuronal ensembles in controlling visually guided behavior and their influence on visual working memory [@carrillo2019].
Research has also delved into the use of aggregated plots for multidimensional visual analysis, although these don't explicitly mention ensembles [@fofonov2018].

The concept of fast ensemble representations has been investigated to understand high-level perceptual impressions based on visual information [@leib2016].
Additionally, the aesthetic complexity of visual information has been quantified using information theory, offering a potential framework for ensemble-based representations [@karjus2023].

Long-term stability of neuronal ensembles in the visual cortex has been studied, shedding light on their potential role in visual perception [@perez2021].
Ensemble visualization techniques, particularly in computer simulations, have also been reviewed [@afzal2019].
Lastly, the structure of neural networks has been shown to affect working memory, which could have implications for visual ensembles [@leavitt2017].

### Bland-Altman Plots

The study of multidimensional ensembles has seen applications in the field of data visualization. 
[@szafir2017] showed that understanding color differences could improve the design of visualizations that require the viewer to integrate multiple pieces of information. 
This work suggested that effective visualization tools could be designed by leveraging the human ability to process multidimensional ensembles rapidly.

Bland-Altman Plots are widely used in clinical research for assessing the agreement between two measurement techniques by plotting the differences against the means [@bland1986]. 
They offer a straightforward representation of data, making them a popular choice for visualizing measurement bias. 
However, the plots are conventionally one-dimensional, primarily focusing on mean differences and limits of agreement.

### The intersection of Multidimensional Ensembles and Bland-Altman Plots

The application of multidimensional ensembles in Bland-Altman Plots could potentially offer a more nuanced understanding of data. 
For example, integrating color coding to indicate standard deviation and shape variations to indicate skewness could offer additional layers of information in a single plot [@szafir2017]. 
Such an approach could leverage our innate abilities in ensemble perception to offer a more comprehensive assessment of agreement between multiple sets of measurement techniques [@szafir2016].

### Gaps in Research

While the fields of ensemble perception and data visualization have seen significant growth, there is a lack of research focusing on the application of ensemble perception, particularly multidimensional ensembles, in Bland-Altman Plots. 
This gap points to the need for empirical studies designed to validate theoretical frameworks and to assess the practical utility of incorporating multidimensional ensembles into Bland-Altman Plots.

## Methods:

Ensemble perception involves the rapid and often unconscious extraction of summary statistics from a set of similar items [@chong2003], [@whitney2014]. 
In the context of multidimensional ensembles, this would refer to the simultaneous extraction of various features such as mean, variance, and other statistical attributes across multiple dimensions [@maule2015], [@haberman2015].
Understanding this concept will provide a unique way to interpret Bland-Altman plots that contain data from multiple dimensions.

Traditionally, Bland-Altman plots present the difference between two sets of measurements against their mean, providing a graphical representation of agreement or bias.
However, this one-dimensional representation might not capture the full complexity of real-world data, where measurements can often be multidimensional [@dakin1997].
Given the human brain's ability to rapidly process multidimensional ensemble statistics [@haberman2015], incorporating this aspect into Bland-Altman plots might yield a more nuanced interpretation [@bauer2009], [@szafir2016].

One way to incorporate multidimensionality into Bland-Altman plots is by adding layers that represent different statistical attributes. 
For example, varying shades of color could indicate the standard deviation within each plotted point, and shape variations could indicate another dimension such as skewness or kurtosis [@szafir2017]. 
This model would require human observers to simultaneously extract multiple summary statistics, leveraging the brain's capabilities in ensemble perception [@chong2003].

In this proposed study, we utilize color coding to represent varying levels of variability in Bland-Altman plots. 
To ensure the universal interpretability of the plots [@ware2012], the color palette will be selected with care, taking into account potential issues such as color blindness.

For this study, two Bland-Altman plots will be generated. 
A traditional plot without color-coding and a plot using the color-coding technique we propose. 
Both plots will be presented to a group of participants that includes both experts and non-experts in data interpretation and statistics. 
The participants will be required to interpret the plots and complete a questionnaire to assess their comprehension and speed of interpretation.

For a layer of interactivity in our study, we will generate interactive Bland-Altman plots incorporating ensemble coding of variability through color gradations. 
Interactivity will be implemented via D3, providing detailed information about each data point when hovered over, as well as zoom features allowing users to zero in on areas of interest.

### Design of the User Studies

User studies will be designed to assess the effectiveness of the interactive Bland-Altman plots in conveying information about the variability of data points. 
The studies will consist of two parts:

**Task-based Evaluation:** Participants will be given a set of tasks to complete using both the interactive color-coded Bland-Altman plot and a traditional static Bland-Altman plot. 
Tasks will involve identifying specific data points, interpreting data variability, and answering questions about the overall data trend. 
Metrics such as task completion time, success rate, and error rate will be recorded [@rubin2008].

**Subjective Evaluation:** After completing the tasks, participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire assessing their user experience. 
The questionnaire will include items related to the perceived ease of use, satisfaction, and preference between the traditional and interactive color-coded Bland-Altman plots.

## Discussion: 

We anticipate that the application of ensemble coding for variability will aid in the comprehension of Bland-Altman plots. 
Based on ensemble coding principles, the color-coded plot should enable faster and more accurate interpretation of data variability [@haberman2012]. 
This method has the potential to enhance the interpretability and utility of these graphs, making them accessible to a broader audience and facilitating more efficient data communication.
