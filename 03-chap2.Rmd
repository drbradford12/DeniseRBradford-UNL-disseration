## Abstract:

A chart is similar to a sentence in that it presents a single, straightforward piece of information and visually represents data to facilitate comprehension. 
For example, a chart could be a bar graph depicting sales over the course of a year, a pie chart illustrating the percentage distribution of a budget, or a scatter plot illustrating the correlation between two variables. 
In the same way that a sentence expresses a single complete thought, a chart conveys a single data narrative.

In contrast, a dashboard is analogous to a paragraph. 
It is a collection of charts (similar to sentences) that present a more comprehensive view of the data landscape. 
Each chart on the dashboard contributes to the overall comprehension of the situation, similar to how each sentence in a paragraph contributes to the larger concept. 
A dashboard may combine multiple graphs, tables, and metrics to provide an all-encompassing view of a company's performance, a project's development, or market trends.

In contrast, a dashboard integrates these individual 'data stories' to create a multidimensional, comprehensive understanding of a larger data scenario. 
Charts are the building blocks of dashboards, just as sentences are the building blocks of paragraphs.

This write-up explores the concept of considering an entire dashboard as a well orchestrated collection of charts in data visualization. 
However, this study proposes a novel approach where the entire dashboard is treated as a single chart, leveraging its interactive and interconnected elements to enhance data visualization and insights.

## Introduction:
<!-- What? Why? How?
Research Question; Summary of Proposal
-->
"How do changes in real-time data displayed on a dashboard affect ensemble perception and consequently, the user's ability to make accurate and rapid decisions based on summary statistics in a dynamic environment?"

This research question explores the intersection of ensemble perception and real-time, dynamic data visualization. 
It considers how ensemble perception operates when data are static and how it adapts to fundamental changes, particularly on a dashboard where such fluctuations are common. 
By focusing on the user's decision-making capabilities, the research also aims to make practical contributions to designing more effective dashboards.

The grammar of graphics is a framework for designing and comprehending data visualizations [@wilkinson2012]. 
By decomposing graphics into components such as data, aesthetics, and geometries, the grammar of graphics provides a structured method for conceiving and creating visualizations. 
It permits a high degree of customization and flexibility in the creation of visualizations.
Static Visualization is commonly used in the communication phase of data science workflows, and data scientists sometimes use them as part of the analysis. 
John Tukey's EDA methods are currently known and well-vetted in the field. 
However, Satyanarayan et al. addressed this by introducing a high-level grammar of graphics called "Vega-Lite," which presents a set of standardized linguistic rules for producing interactive information visualizations using a concise JSON format for data to be represented by the grammar [@satyanarayan2016]. 
Vega-Lite has been directly implemented in R via the `ggvis` package using the same - albeit slightly lower-level.
The principles of the grammar of graphics can be applied to dashboard design to create more effective and informative dashboards. 

"Graphical Tests for Power Comparison of Competing Designs" by Hofmann et al. presents a graphical method for comparing the power of two or more competing designs in an experimental study [@hofmann2012].
The article demonstrates that the graphical method is a useful tool for comparing the effectiveness of various experimental designs. 
It enables researchers to visualize and compare the effectiveness of different designs in an intuitive and straightforward manner.

Understanding cognitive load is crucial for designing compelling data visualizations, as it influences how users perceive, process, and remember the data presented in the visualization.
When designing visuals, it is essential to consider the cognitive load they may place on the viewer.
Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort required to process information, and minimizing it can enhance a graphic's effectiveness.
In addition, displaying as much raw data as possible while minimizing cognitive load can improve the graphic's clarity and precision.
Here are some general guidelines for making better graphics with works from Few [@few2012], Tufte [@tufte1983], and Cairo [@cairo2016]:

1. Keep it simple - Avoid overwhelming the viewer with too much information at once by employing a clear and concise design with minimal distractions.

2. Use visual hierarchy - Utilize size, color, contrast, and placement to highlight important information and direct the viewer's focus.

3. Choose appropriate charts - Choose the chart type that best illustrates the data and facilitates comprehension.

4. Label clearly - Use labels that are clear and concise for axes, legends, and other essential information to avoid confusion.

5. Use data-to-ink ratio - Focus on the data by minimizing the amount of non-data ink, such as decorative elements or excessive grid lines.

6. Avoid distortion - Use appropriate scaling and avoid distortions to ensure that the graphics accurately represent the data.

7. Provide context - Add context to assist the viewer in comprehending the significance of the data and its relevance to the topic.

### Dashboard Design

A dashboard is a visual display of the essential information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the data can be monitored at a glance [@few2006]. 
The process of creating visually informative and interactive interfaces that present data and key performance indicators (KPIs) in a consolidated and simple-to-understand format is dashboard design. 
The objective is to provide users with insights and enable them to make intelligent decisions based on the presented data.

### Grammar of Graphics

The central concept of the grammar of graphics is the representation of visualizations as a combination of essential components, including data, aesthetics, geometries, scales, and statistics. 
These components can be combined in numerous ways to generate a vast array of visual representations. 
For instance, data is the foundational element, aesthetics map data variables to visual properties, geometries determine the representation of data points, scales map data values to visual values, and statistics transform the data prior to visualization.

<!--Identification of gaps and opportunities in the current state of dashboard design. -->
While the grammar of graphics provides a powerful theoretical framework for data visualization, there may be research gaps in its application to dashboard design and functionality. 
Such as the following missing pieces:

**Interactivity:** 
Graphics grammar primarily emphasizes static visualizations. 
However, dashboards are inherently interactive, allowing users to explore the data and interact with it.
There is a need for research to determine how to effectively incorporate the principles of the grammar of graphics into interactive dashboards while maintaining a positive user experience and avoiding user overload.

**Data Synchronization:** 
Dashboards often present data from multiple sources or datasets. 
Ensuring data synchronization across different visualizations and components is critical to maintain accuracy and consistency. 
Research is needed to investigate methods for handling data updates, refresh rates, and synchronization challenges in dashboard design.

**User-Centered Design:** 
The grammar of graphics focuses on data-driven principles, but effective dashboard design also requires a deep understanding of user needs, tasks, and goals. 
Further research should investigate how to integrate user-centered design practices into the application of the grammar of graphics in dashboard development.


## Dashboard Design as the Symphony of Charts:

<!--Explanation of the principles and concepts behind the unified chart dashboard approach.-->
Here is how published theory relates graphic grammar to dashboard design:

**Data Layer:**  is the foundation of visualizations in the grammar of graphics. 
This means that data should drive the dashboard design process. 
Dashboards should be constructed using accurate, pertinent, and well-organized data that aligns with the dashboard's objectives.

**Aesthetics Layer:**  refer to the mapping of data variables to visual properties such as color, size, shape, and position. 
Aesthetics play a crucial role in dashboard design for accurately and effectively representing data. 
Choosing appropriate colors, scales, and shapes for visual elements expedites users' ability to comprehend and interpret data.

**Geometries:**  determine how data points, such as bars, lines, points, or areas, are represented in the visualization. 
The selection of appropriate geometries is crucial in dashboard design for communicating the intended message. 
Various types of charts and graphs may be used to represent various types of data or to illustrate particular relationships.

**Composition and Layers:** Graphics grammar permits combining multiple layers of data and geometries to generate more complex visualizations. 
This translates to structuring information hierarchically in dashboard design, utilizing multiple charts, graphs, or elements to present a comprehensive view of the data without overwhelming the user.

**Faceting:**  is the process of dividing data into subsets and displaying them as multiple smaller visualizations. 
Faceting can be used in dashboard design to display multiple aspects of the data simultaneously, making it easier for users to compare and contrast various parts of the data.

**Annotations:** as mentioned in the previous response, annotations are a crucial component of statistical graphics and also apply to dashboard design. 
Annotations strategically placed can aid users in comprehending key insights, provide context, and guide them through the dashboard's narrative.

Using the principles of the grammar of graphics, designers can create visually appealing, informative, and user-friendly dashboards that effectively convey data-driven insights to their audience.

## Experimential Ideas/Methods to test theory:

Testing the effectiveness of a dashboard as a unified chart involves evaluating its usability, user experience, and the effectiveness of conveying information to the target audience. 
Here are some key steps and methods to test the effectiveness of a dashboard:

**Usability Testing:** 
Conduct usability testing with real users to observe how they interact with the dashboard. 
Use think-aloud protocols, where users vocalize their thoughts while using the dashboard. 
Observe if users can easily navigate, interpret data, and find relevant information using the collection of charts.

**Eye-Tracking:** 
Use eye-tracking technology to understand where users focus their attention on the dashboard. 
This will reveal if users are drawn to the critical information presented through the collection of charts.

**User Interviews and Observations:** 
Conduct interviews with users to gain deeper insights into their experiences and preferences regarding the collection of charts. 
Observe how users interact with the dashboard in their natural environment.
