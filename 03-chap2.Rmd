<!--## Abstract

Interactive dashboards are frequently employed for data visualization and serve as a means of providing context for exploratory data tools.
In this paper, we will explore the scope of how dashboards are a collection of charts in data visualization to present a straightforward piece of information and visually represent data to facilitate comprehension.
The research objective of this study is to investigate how changes in real-time data displayed on a dashboard affect ensemble perception and the user's ability to make accurate and rapid decisions based on summary statistics in a dynamic environment.

## Introduction

The majority of data from the real world are high-dimensional. 
However, high-dimensional data suffers from the "curse of dimensionality" and is hard to study because it's hard to visualize and compute. 
Techniques for reducing the number of dimensions in a dataset so that it is manageable become useful tools in data analysis. 
For example, dimensionality reduction makes it easier to see, sort, group, compress, and visualize high-dimensional data, among other things. 
These mostly include linear and nonlinear techniques. 
One well-known linear method is Principal Components Analysis (PCA). 
Others are t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Factor Analysis (FA). 
When dimensionality reduction methods are linear, they assume that the data are on or near a linear subspace of the high-dimensional space. 
Nonlinear techniques, on the other hand, don't depend on the linearity assumption. 
Some nonlinear methods are Multidimensional Scaling, Isomap, Maximum Variance Unfolding, Kernel PCA, Diffusion Maps, Multilayer Autoencoders, Locally Linear Embedding, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Hessian LLE, Manifold Charting, and Locally Linear Coordination. 
It is possible to work with complex nonlinear data using nonlinear methods.

Also, real-world data generally has different types, such as numeric, ordinal, and categorical attributes. 
For example, The fuel economy data are the result of vehicle testing done at the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle manufacturers with oversight by EPA. 
The dataset has both categorical and numerical attributes. 
The categorical attributes are Make, Model, Transmission, Drive, Class, and Fuel. 
The numerical attributes are highway miles per gallon (hwy), city miles per gallon (cty), number of cylinders (cyl), Year, and engine displacement (displ).
Keep in mind that the Year attribute can also be thought of as an ordinal trait. 

Methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and K-means all only work with numerical data. 
Other methods such as the rule for association mining, Decision Trees, and Random Forests can be used to work with categorical data. 
When there is mixed data, a preprocessing step is taken to change one type of data to another before the methods are used. 
Usually, categorized methods are used to change numerical values. 
One-of-k coding is often used to change categorical numbers. 
These new dimensionality reduction methods, like the ones we've already talked about, were only tested on one type of data: numerical data. 
They can't be used directly on categorical or mixed-type datasets. 
A data preprocessing process that changes either type of data to another also loses information. 
We deal with this issue in this work by showing a way to find the difference between mixed-type data points. 
We also suggest using dimensionality reduction methods to make it easier to see how numeric and categorical attributes are used in mixed-type data. 
The steps allow users to see and interact with mixed-type datasets. 
For example, users can choose clusters on the projection map and then get statistical data or trends from those clusters. 
This graphical study helps one to see how the mixed-type data are spread out and which features are very different in one cluster compared to the others. 
The following describes how this paper is organized. 
In Section 2, we look at the research that has been done on dimensionality reduction and distance learning. 
In Section 3, we talk about our suggested methods in more detail. 
Section 4 uses studies to test how well our methods work. 
Section 5 talks about the end.
